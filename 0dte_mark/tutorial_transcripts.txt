(00:03) okay what's up everyone Mark Anderson here construction worker turn Z GT hedge fund manager so I've gotten a lot of feedback from you guys that maybe I'm going a little over your head with some of the option information so in an effort to dumb this down and take you guys on the journey that I think a lot of people are interfacing with us to learn how to trade this is my buddy Connor he used to work with us or work with me at ripling when I was an SDR and uh he's been doing some stuff for me on
(00:29) LinkedIn so what we've done is I've funded a real account using thinker swim with uh 50 Grand and basically Connor is in between starting a new job and for the course of about three weeks I'm just going to pay him a normal salary to basically study and learn how to trade options and basically by the end of the fourth July holiday Connor is going to take over um trading this stuff with obviously my watchful eye of looking that within trade Steward but we're going to go through all the steps at a
(00:59) much lower level of how I learn to trade options how to trade options and basically how to build a portfolio the whole thought behind this is for someone that's doing something full-time if they're good and they teach you you're going to get shitty results if they're great and they teach you you're GNA good results however someone's outstanding at something and they teach you you should get outstanding results so basically we're going to take Connor to proficient option portfolio Traer with
(01:24) institutional scale through my teachings over about a 100 hours in three weeks we're going to document it all here show you all the back test all of the Automation and trade Steward share it all with you so you could all do the same thing and the goal is basically to get from a $50,000 account all the way to $100,000 account in six months or roughly by the end of the year which is about two grand a week um I'll let Conor kind of talk a little bit about his lifestyle and experience with options in general and how ridiculously uh crazy he
(01:53) kind of thinks I am as well so Conor talk about that Journey a little bit yeah yeah I'll just start off basic saying yeah I'm just a normal dude uh got a wife and a daughter work full-time we'll be working a full-time job you know N9 to5 so nothing crazy there um and when it comes to my options background I think the only op only trading background that I have is I've played with Charles swab account trading some dividend stocks but it's literally about a I think I had a thousand dollars
(02:21) in that Charles swab account nothing crazy played with a little bit but yeah that's pretty much my whole entire background when it comes to trading um when I first started working with Mark and he was selling SPX and stuff I didn't even know what SPX was I don't know what you know derivative trading I mean options are anything like that so basically coming starting from zero um but excited to be part of the journey Yeah so basically what we're gonna do here is the first step that I kind of view Connor is going to learn the best
(02:50) from is we're going to do our back testing which is basically our practice and we're to learn that once we learn the practice of that back testing we're in turn going to then be able to program the spots on trade Steward and at that point we're going to be able to learn how to basically make portfolios and then when we get to that point we'll start modit monitoring those portfolios and optimizing it so the first step here and for your guys' self study is I told Connor to take the options Omega inter
(03:17) of back testing boot camp which is free on options Mega Academy and he'll go to that and basically the expectation that we've set is we have 15 minute chat basically every day and then he just puts in about an hour of work of that so 4 to1 ratio um first we will basically go over back test and Connor will just ask any questions with that background in regards to the back test here so if you look at this this is a back test Connor basically what this is is it lets us know if past data is indicative of
(03:44) future returns and our goal is to basically match these so we're going to beat them up as much as possible this first um aspect is the ticker we will always use SPX because we're trading zero DT options these are the strategies that you can build basically everything is going to be made up of short input calls um which will be long or short the market short or long volatility I personally like to just add legs like this to have an understanding in regards to what these look like um so this is an iron Condor it's a screwed iron Condor
(04:16) short putut long call short call uh long call this is AD wide Zer DT we want to make sure that these are always unchecked so it can fit within the parameters of these strikes we'll make it for Connor's account which will be 50 Grand and we'll do a fixed one lot we'll always use exact Z DT so we'll get these with doing this this enters every day at 25 as one vix filter for a Max move which again will always be our cap for one vix filter when we're doing this as well I always like to have the weekly
(04:48) just as a check and have them all checked in regards to this this means that it will trade the trade whenever we please with a 1.6% um max overnight move not really going to use technical indicators gaps Inay moves squeeze metrics or anything like that profit and loss we'll basically always be using we're going to use National bid best offer minus which will just always offer um the worst potential pricing that we have the options of to get in throughout the course of this then we will always use married percent
(05:17) losses um to Dollar losses so percents and percents will never have dollars to dollars because I would believe that's that's somewhat curvefitting in regards to that so A 40% profit take and a 1X L on this then when we go down here we'll have an exit an early exit time we don't really need to use that then we'll just have our traditional slippage here and stop-loss slippage when we're down here we want to ignore wide bit ass so weird 2020 trades don't get factored in our back test we'll always cap at
(05:50) non-operating profits so that means whenever we hit a profit Target it doesn't take the topof the- minute data it just takes whatever our profit would have been plus the exit slippage same thing with the stock stop loss will always require two profit takes to hit so it's harder than in the game it will never require two consecutive stop losses because that would make it easier than it is an actual game and then we effectively just run this um any questions Connor pretty straightforward yeah pretty straightforward so far on a
(06:17) lot of that stuff but when it comes to the I was going through um options Omega um and they were talking about contracts and contracts seem like they made sense on the number of contracts but what's it mean like what is it actually mean like when I say I'm putting one contract in there so one contract basically means we're selling one spread of this premium so if you see here this is $5 and $3 this roughly collects $8 in premium times it by 100 that's 800 bucks so basically what this means if we sold one
(06:49) contract we would always be selling around $800 every time this trade triggered whereas then you just times it by two three four five per contract right yep and basically that that's going to dictate the premium and then the other thing too when we're back testing which I think is a good practice for everyone in real life is you know if you don't have a $100,000 account you probably shouldn't be running test on a $100,000 account so you can see here that we use 50 Grand which is Connor's
(07:16) account and we ran it back to 2020 and then it gave us the actual results of this trade so that would look at a 0. N9 9 9% loss which would be you know close to five grand in regards to our portfolio so this is proba probably not something um we would want and then also for breast practices I made Connor a tag here so we say Conor video test and then we save it under here in tags so Connor can look at it it's now saved and then how we will communicate also over these and we'll share this with you too is you could basically just
(07:51) write Connor and then question mark and then you could write something in here so basically the whole goal of all this is that what Connor is doing is really not any different than what you guys on YouTube would effectively be doing granted I'm here coaching him and looking at stuff so he's going to progress a lot quicker and not make as many mistakes but I'm hoping that the mistakes and questions he have um will you know also be similar to yours so you should be able to figure out quickly but I basically want to show
(08:20) you guys that when you divorce your psychology you know which is basically what Connor does because he's got a job he doesn't need to make money trading it's really not his Capital I'm teaching him so he should and he's also treating this like a job of just following the rules I think you guys will see that it's often your thoughts and everything around that that prevent you from Trading success in your greed and your fear rather than just the actual practice of it as well as there's a lot
(08:45) of bad information out there so looking forward to keeping this going but basically the homework after this video is Connor is just going to go ahead and take the options Omega back testing boot camp uh take any notes or questions and we'll basically resync and show you guys what the progress is on on the next one then we'll go into learning trade steart Automation and then we'll go into building a portfolio and we'll get live trading monitoring so thank you guys and we will see you guys the next episode

Transcript:
(00:00) it's like the first step of a back test is we just trade it with no commission no slippage no fees no stop loss no profit take because that proves that there's Edge there now once we've proven that there's Edge there we can go through an iteration of how do we capture this Edge efficiently through our mechanics and you know our assumptions of slippage once we add those it's still worth doing perfect yeah that makes sense so like this is like all right you the first time you run it without that because he was
(00:28) showing that in the video he's like this is I'm going to explain this to you what it looks like without it and then then he added it to it and it shows like oh this like you said you run it without it all right this looks like it might be one let's see what it actually looks like when we put it into play and you add all the miscellaneous things and this is like a more like here's like a basically like the play in football practice it's like drawn up and then you run the play and it's like this is what
(00:54) it might actually look like yeah um and the other thing to that too is this all comes into like theory and practice and that's kind of like the fragility of it so if you were to just sell like a 15 cent option with no commission no slippage and fees it's you're going to look like you're a billionaire however to get into that position because even in the SPX it's very liquid so there's a lot of people trying to buy and sell contracts to get in when they shop that between the bid ask it will be between
(01:22) like 10 and 15 cents so if you're selling 15 C options you can lose 50% of your profit just getting in so that's why like we're normally selling a dollar $2 we're not messing with those things because if we get 5cent extra slippage on getting out or five cents extra slippage getting in that takes 50% of our profit you know what I'm saying makes sense all right so those are like theories and practice thing that's part of it but that's like again IV minus RV and plaid ball minus RV so that's like
(01:54) is there Edge can we make money off this and then it's basically anything we sell especially on the put side is going to pass that first equation then the real question is how do we efficiently go about doing this all right um and that's kind of the iteration we're going to go through and then the thing we'll do as well with that is it's like okay if we can like if we if we're only selling a put for example like we get it doesn't take any buying power to sell the call because it's we still have the same risk we just
(02:30) take it on both sides so then if that call just increases our Max recoverable risk and has a positive expected value of like $2 it probably makes sense to sell it so this is the iteration we'll go through is is like single test adding to that test optimizing to that test putting in portfolio perfect yeah perfect makes sense and um the Kinder just to make sure I'm we're I'm on the right path on slippage um entry slippage like for instance I think no this was diving into exit slippage so exit slippage only
(03:08) exits when there's profit so like and so if you have your profit Mark at like $1 like if you put 05 in exit slippage it's only going to it doesn't mean you're just going to be exited at 0.5 it's gonna it might be like 1.5 um if you put 0. five in because it's waiting until you hit your profit yeah so what the back tester does is when it hits that mid price which is if your profit is let's say your profit is $120 when there's a bit of 115 and there's an Ask of 125 you hit 120 so
(03:42) then basically what that'll say is that you pay you you ended up actually selling it for a115 because you got filled at the bid however that exit slippage because again IV minus RV minus commission slippage and fees is we will most likely only be using a stoploss because if we use a stoploss and a profit take all of a sudden we've just doubled our entry slippage you know what I'm saying so like now we've created a structure that makes it more difficult to capture that edge all right so yes that is correct
(04:22) but we will only use that function like if we traded a one data expiration and we wanted to get out before the market closed we would have exit slippage and if we use a profit take we would do that to get exit slippage but in general anything that we trade that's like a dollar $2 $3 we're just not going to be using a profit take because it's just gonna eat too much of our profit right all right all right that makes sense so only use stop stop slippage stop-loss slippage to help us be more profitable
(04:49) basically correct and also when we think about that too is like entry slippage is going to be less because if the market moves really fast when we're trying to enter we just resubmit the order we don't have risk because we haven't entered the position in yet but like our stoploss slippage because every dollar it goes past our stop loss is money we lose and we want to Caper risk we're willing to pay more to get out of that you know what I'm saying so and also we're the market taker so like if the
(05:18) market rips down our ORD already in we're just going to take whatever that environment may be and we'll probably have to pay more to do that whereas when we're getting into the market we're the market basically maker like we're coming into it like pay less pay this much to take on this risk and if the price changes be like I want to change that so that's kind of like another way to look at it and also like if we're selling a $1 put option we're only shopping a dollar to you know a doll five a11 on
(05:47) that bit ask but if we have a $1 put option and we have a stop loss at 4X that means we're we've already lost $400 so the options at $500 so when we're trying to buy back a $500 option that bid ask could be between $5 and 5.45 so we would obviously even if the percentage is the same we would pay more to do that so exit slippage is or stoploss slippage will always be more than the entry slippage um and then I'm not sure if you noticed this but in options Omega it says cap stoploss at Value cap profit
(06:23) take at Value have you seen that no I haven't noticed that yet um so under MK you're always going to want to have those checks because that g basically what that does is whatever price you said your stop was going to be it just takes that price and then adds whatever your slippage was so check uh cap what cap uh operating losses at stoploss cap operating losses at profit take and then um again we probably won't be using very many profit takes but we want to make the game harder than it is than in
(06:52) person so like if we're using a profit take we're going to click require two consecutive hits for profit take so that means two cons minutes it would have had to have our bid ass value so that creates a high degree of certainty that we would have filled and then for a stoploss we do not check have to hit because the second hits we want to be like uh you know sometimes we may not get out with that but we're just G to try to get out you know makes sense you just want to try to get out as fast as possible basically so
(07:24) you can stop losing money yeah and also like it's creating a Rosier picture if we were require it to hit our stop loss two consecutive minutes whereas in real life we're probably just getting out on the first minute but for a profit take we you know want to make it harder all right and in that profit take because it's like for you said two consecutive minutes would it also allow you to have chance for higher profit too like the longer you stay in it or yeah but do it or not really yeah when you click the
(07:56) profit take that means that the bot would have an order trying to buy that back in the market so we could potentially get filled at like five or 10 more but we're not going to count that because that's just a Rosier picture like we know we're going to get what we bought when we have two consecutive profit takes we have exit slippage and um you know it's just all more conc so like we're all these back tests I we're basically going to outperform the reason I beat them up like this is because like if the market
(08:23) moves really fast we make it one day every three months where we have like four times the amount of slippage so when that Happ happens it just gets factored into our 40 occurrences and we're still below what the back test was expected all right

Transcript:
(00:00) I was experimenting a little bit with um like the strategies on straight trade St like I'm I'm understanding the back testing right I'm understanding we put this we put this trade in back testing to see if this has Edge or not but then I want to understand like the theory of the trade like why do you um you know short a put and then long a put in the same trade that's an example um when we when because like I know what that means is you're buying and put you're selling a put and buying a put but why would you
(00:37) do that and I looked a little bit into it and I saw that you know it's balancing that out we talked about it last time buying your capping power but that's just one an example of like I want to be begin to learn you know the reasoning be or the strategy Behind These trades because I think it'll help me understand like instead of just plugging numbers in I'll understand why I'm plugging these numbers in yeah um so let's go a few pieces at a time so I know we talked last time it's like
(01:06) you buy a put you sell a put so that's basically um we're just capping our buying power so you remember that long put is effectively dead to us yep okay and then like on a condor for example you know what is the theory behind a condor okay so a condor is a directionless trade or otherwise known as delta neutral do you know what Delta is um that's the percent change right uh yeah kind of Delta is the is a proxy for basically notional size so if you owned one share of SPX you have 100 Deltas of the SPX so basically if the market like
(01:52) if you sold a 30 Delta put and the market went up it would Decay or lose value to like a 10 Delta put so that like as we get closer to expiration if the option is in the money it's going to be 100 Deltas if the option is out of the money it's going to be zero Deltas all right so basically the whole point of a condor is that we're collecting twice as much credit but we're also taking risk on both sides so Delta is also aoxy for percent of it expiring in or out of the money so if you have a 30
(02:27) Delta put or a 30 Delta call roughly will expire in the money 30% of the time if you have a 10 Delta it will roughly expire 10% of the time so we choose Credit in there like you put like hey I put 10 Delta that means it's going to expire 10% of the money it's a rough proxy estimation it's not exact but and you're making that estimation basically based off of data yeah that's just an implied data it's a it's just a rough proxy for it so like when we're trading a condor we're basically taking twice as
(03:01) much credit and not taking a directional stance for that option so like if it ping pongs up and down we'll make twice as much money so like if you think about it and I sent you those trade essays with that David wrote so like yeah if the S&P is at 5,000 and we were to sell 30 Delta put let's say that's at 4,950 okay and we collected a dollar for that if the Market expires at 5,000 then all of a sudden we made a dollar you know what I'm saying but if we sold a $1 put at uh 4970 and we sold a $1 call at
(03:46) 5,30 and then it expired at 5,000 we in turn then made $2 you know what I'm saying so if the market doesn't move you're rewarded twice as much however if we sold that same $1 put at $49 70 and the market went to uh 5,40 we made a dollar and we would have lost more than that on the call side and we would have basically not been able to do it so the way to think of it is the benefit of a condor is that we get to collect twice as much credit for the same amount of buying power because if you are 100 wide on a put cost $10,000
(04:25) of buying power if you're 100 wide on a call and 100 wide on a put but it still cost $1,000 $10,000 basically like um it's basically like a covering your back you know if the market does move you're gonna make money off of it and if it doesn't move you're G to make money off of it with the Condor right yeah I mean you're taking more of a non-directional stance than directional stance so that is what's called a delta neutral or like short volatility like we're only playing it should move less than the expected
(05:00) move it's a conservative play basically yeah and then also the thing is like if we have a $1 put and we're managing it at a $2 stop loss if the market rips down 15 points we could just get stopped out relatively quickly whereas if we sold a dollar put in a dollar call and we put the stop on both the call and the put and the market ripped down quick that extra dollar of credit would allow us to hold on to the trade a little bit longer so wouldn't get stopped out and then when it came back up it would it
(05:33) would like we'd still be in the trade so that makes sense so the first part of a condor could be like the buying power of it and the second part is the selling power so if it's like if it that stop loss like you just said that's why they have like there's like the two leg there's the four legs of it like up here for the buy up here is for the sell is that what you're saying yeah and like if we were to go through it and you can stop me at any point with like pros and cons there's basically the pro of a
(05:58) condor is we collect twice as much credit yep the con of the Condor is we have risk on both sides all right the pro of the Condor is that by collecting more credit we can use a smaller stop on the entire trade and not get quickly uh stopped out on a quick whip Shaw the con of that is that we're shopping a larger order so we could potentially get more slippage when it moves like that the pro of a condor is it has no Direction so whether it goes up down or sideways we relatively have like an even exposure
(06:33) the con of the Condor is that you have risk in both both ways and makes sense and in general like puts are just priced richer they're gonna you're gonna make more money and everything because people are afraid of the downside not of The Upside so even though it's directionless and delta neutral you're kind of slightly short the market in general because the calls aren't priced as well so like that's theory and practice but in tune that's basically a condor does that kind of make sense or was there
(07:02) yeah I think that makes sense when you're talking about it seems like you know you're you're you're not playing too aggressive but you still have risk on both sides because you're playing both sides but you're kind of protecting yourself from both sides as well because you having this the stop do you have a stop on the profit side like on the call like um like do you have a like on your stop loss I know you have a stop on the selling it but do you have a stop on the the top like you don't want to go above
(07:30) too much on it as well yeah so there's different ways to manage it so basically we can manage it as a condor or we could just open it as a condor and then manage each leg separately so there's benefits to each by managing both legs you're not going to get stopped out as quickly on a smaller stop however you're going to eat more slippage and then you may just be holding on to a trade that's not as bad so when you say slippage what do you mean by I know entry s sage and X eat slippage but like um how do what does it
(08:04) mean by like eating that so um that's the cost to get out of the trade to cut our risk exposure and we since we're in the trade we're willing to pay a much higher amount to get out of the trade because we now hold risk so the more legs you have in that the harder it is so like let's say you know pretend like you were back in uh elementary school and you wanted to trade like your snack pack for a fruit rollup SO trading a snack pack for a fruit rollup is going to be relatively easy because you're
(08:38) just trading one for one you just need to find one person with the fruit roll to trade for but all of a sudden if you're walking through the courtyard and you're like I want to trade my snack pack a bag of carrots and my turkey sandwich for a fruit roll up and a Tang it's going to be much harder to find that market so you may have to basically pay more of a discount to do that so that is kind of like the concept of basically what that Condor looks like and then and each leg is representing your snack pack your turkey sandwich
(09:11) your uh so more legs you have the harder it is and the more you might have to pay to get out of that yeah I mean on a everyday day-to-day basis the SPX is pretty liquid so it doesn't really affect us but the time when we really need to get out it's going to hurt a lot more so I'm basically juicing up the slippage on those trades because I know that I'm basically outperform the expected slippage and then once every month or two I'll I'll probably get hit pretty hard on it which will basically
(09:44) then form the back test but the main point of that Condor is like it's part of our portfolio so by like not taking Direction and taking more credit as the market moves so like a condor I like to do at the beginning of the day because once we have that going if the market moves in a direction we'll get out and then all of a sudden we start putting on more trades that are maybe just on one side but if we put the trade on first thing in the morning and the market doesn't move at all and now we're
(10:10) sitting on a bunch of credit so these are all just vectors of how like you are going to build that portfolio eventually and the way I want you to think of it is like we understand each trade and then we're going to start understanding that portfolio and like a quick example I could kind of give in regards to this is like if you I know I haven't showed you an options account very much but if we were to look at this and then we go to basically like the options this called the options change um so this may the expiration
(10:47) here okay here we are so if this makes a little more sense it's like so the right hand side is the foot side and the left hand side is basically yeah I mean excuse me the right hand side is the call side the left hand oh yeah yeah I'm screwing up here left- hand side is the put side yeah you said yep they see it up here on the left hand corner so you could see here with the put the reason it's vertical is because we'd sell this that's the bid and then we would buy this and that's the vertical so that's that's why it's
(11:20) called a vertical spread you know what I'm saying and then in the call it's the exact same thing we would sell this and then above we would buy it so it's vertical but it's just flipped and then theoretically when you look at this it kind of makes sense so like the market goes up tick tick tick tick tick um with the pricing in this direction these puts lose value and we make money the market goes up in this direction tick tick tick tick tick we lose value on these calls so basally that's a little bit of a
(11:53) intro iteration to this I just want to take small chunks with it for you yeah that's perfect that makes more sense yeah that should kind of give you a better understanding of that and we're going to be all automated but I think by seeing that it makes sense with the vertical spread so it's like you have price in the middle the price goes up those puts are below vertically it makes money the price goes up the calls are over here it makes money you get hurt all right all right so on the downside it's making money on the upside it's
(12:19) making money yeah and also to further help you remember this it's like we call that long leg of the vertical spread a wing and then when you trade a condor Condors have wings so that is basically like a good way to theoretically remember it D do you have any more questions in regards to that specifically no that's perfect man I think that um just helps me understand like the importance of understand because we always use like sports analogies and stuff I feel like uh now I'm starting to try to understand like
(12:48) all right here's the plays that you're telling me to run I understand why do these plays work you know like this is the underlying thing too like I'm glad you're picking up on that it's like understanding it not NE necessarily to some complex option thing but why you're doing it and thinking about why you're doing it and what you get out of it before the numbers because then you can if you're hitting your theory against a wall like imagine if you're playing tennis when it comes back
(13:17) to you're G to understand like you're going to be able to anticipate where it's going to Ricochet off the wall to hit it back and that's what we're doing here whereas when we're doing this I'm like serving you the ball and then you're hitting the ball back to me and I'll basically tell you where to anticipate it and look at makes sense and that makes you like understand your portfolio more right because like you that's like I'm assuming this is straight assumption but like you have
(13:43) you're gonna have a Condors you're gonna have you know those those short H like the long put you know and then the short put and you're going to have all those different types of Trades stacked in a portfolio for a specific reason right like each one has their own reasoning be and then we're basically going to program the portfolio that we start with no direction if the market were to go up or down now all of a sudden we would either take off positions in the direction that's getting threatened or
(14:10) add more positions in the opposite direction and basically we're always going to be somewhat delta neutral and Direction lless and just playing that we don't think it's going to move much but as the market starts to move in certain directions our Bots and our portfolios that we've planned of are going to respond to that not even necessarily to always make money but in a way that it could offset money we're losing because not losing money is like not turning the ball over it's really important like if
(14:36) we can punt it's really hard for the other team to score a touchdown can hold in the field goal and that's basically what like first downs punting we don't want to turn the ball over you know yeah that makes sense yeah that makes sense it really does so it's like we're just trying to stay like you keep saying delta neutral but still making money basically like we're not trying to make drastic um drastic you know Hail Mary plays we're just trying to continuously just chip away like you say all the time
(15:04) like hit hit first base hits with our portfolio yeah like we're trying to have first base hits and like we're not trying to do anything fancy like we're just missionary guys you know what I'm saying like we're just kind of chipping away at it we don't need to do anything fancy or shov awesome yeah that makes sense man um but yeah that's all the questions I had today

Transcript:
(00:02) okay Mark Anderson here construction worker turned zero DT hedge fund manager today we're going to continue teaching Connor how to trade options over the course of the next few weeks basically one important thing that I think will give Connor a unique Advantage here is just psychology being that he's not really emotionally invested in it he can just be invested in the practice I've also done a lot of Tony Robbins events and volunteering and coaching and stuff alongside them as well so I kind of wanted to bring that in into Conor's
(00:31) mental game and one of the main Concepts that they speak about in regard to that is basically everything you've ever seen heard done um or acted out is basically stored in your mind the problem is just recall and the example I would give of that is like you know Connor like do you remember what happened on 911 or the day the world shutdown on covid or like when your daughter was born like do you remember what you had for breakfast do you remember you know how you felt if you kind of talk about that you kind of
(01:01) Jing with it yeah yeah like we were just talking previously you were talking about like what I what I had for breakfast for my daughter born I remembered like I woke up at 3:00 a.m. and you just like you said you have those emotional ties right to this AG you know exactly what you're doing exactly at that time because there's a motion draw to yeah exactly and like you probably don't remember what you had for breakfast on June 8th of 2007 right no yeah so that's kind of the that's kind of the example of it or
(01:28) when people will like have their life flash before their so what we like to do is we used to we like to use that for kind of like a learning hack as well so another example is like you remember 10% of what you read you remember 20% of what you read and hear you remember 40% of what you teach and then you remember 90% of what's like you have emotions tied to and you basically act out and that would kind of be like the example of emotions tied to your daughter being born or 911 or something along those lines the other example too with like
(01:54) Steph Curry is Mastery he's physically enacting that out so basically Steph Curry has made about 3,800 threes in the NBA and over the course of that period he's basically been taking a thousand threes a day for like 25 years so he has to take you know 20,000 threes for every one he makes on the court and that's why he looks so good when he's doing that but the main thing with that is like he's emotionally and physically acting it out and he also has Clarity of what that is so to kind of save Conor time
(02:20) I've basically drawn what that gold poost is so the clarity of what we're trying to do is we're going to be systematic Traders which means we just follow the rules every day we're going to be pure Quant which means we're just BAS on the numbers and back test we're going to have a high time velocity of money meaning creating a lot of occurrences and flipping that money over because we have a small account and need to make money on it we're also going to beat up the back test that we're basing
(02:41) this office to have very conservative assumptions and then our main goal is just get what we bought if the back test ends up bailing or doesn't work or the edge goes away that's actually completely fine what we want is not necessarily the result on the scoreboard but the fact that we went to the game and ran the plays um you down with that Connor yeah yeah down with that I think that definitely is gonna help me out we were going through that yesterday and just to point out kind of like what Mark's saying is um when we were
(03:09) entering in from a back test into trade Stewart it made me realize like how diligent and how uh Point by point I have to be because I kind of when you assume things that's where things can go wrong and that's where you can lose a bunch of money I learned that yesterday so I think this helps you remember what your purpose is for the day and having a clear goal is going to help you stay focused during that yep and then also um with starting with this we've basically like the way uh to do this is like the
(03:37) more we master the basics when we get to the portfolio and it gets uh confusing you'll at least kind of know where you are so the way to look at it is you have unconscious unconfident effective boring he doesn't know what he doesn't know at all if it's right or wrong then you have conscious unconfident where you're aware that you're screwing up so basically if you're on a treasure map that helps a lot then you have conscious competence where if you think about what you're doing you can figure it out which is
(03:59) great and then mask is unconscious competence which you don't have to think about how good you are and basically how we're going to do this is every time before we read every time before Conor record his trade log he's basically going to do what's called an incantation and you basically just say out a mission statement with words that relate emotions to it and then when you say this out loud multiple times and you have some greed of wanting to trade bigger or you want to run a back test before you've done all the work that's a
(04:24) thought in your mind of basically like the devil on your shoulder and the angel on your shoulder and by having read this out to yourself it's going to be a lot easier not to negotiate and justify that in your head because you physically said it out loud and the hardest person AOW to you as yourself I wrote this for Conor basically and what it is is we gave him a name Quant Connor so it's a i Quant Connor see hear feel and know that I will create an abundance of wealth through the short dated index options
(04:48) Market I've cultivated an unwavering conviction to meet the standard of execution and compliance to my trading plan regardless of how I feel or what life throws at me I'm a datadriven and know that success is not the PN on a day-to-day basis the real success is executing per plan day-to-day with a 95% accuracy to the back tested plan small daily losses are a valuable driver of making money on a monthly basis I perform to the best of my ability each day and achieve my mission of making two grand a week uh doubling my account from
(05:17) 50 Grand to 100 Grand over the course of the next six months through data Simplicity and execution I Now command my subconscious mind to guide me to serve and contribute at an ever expanding level showing others the road map to Financial Freedom through my short-dated index off option portfolio I've put in the work to be exactly where I need to be today to deliver now step into the moment six months from now being the person you have become changing account from 50 Grand to 100 Grand and be proud of that person that
(05:40) You' become more give more and able to do more so pretty cool but contextually I don't know how you feel about it you can kind of talk about it I would just recommend reading that out loud once or twice a day or when your emotional stat gets low or you feel that and that's basically just some social proof to deposit in your bank account to continue to follow the plan yeah I love it feel like uh just like what you were saying Mark every time you remind yourself your purpose your Clarity and have a clear
(06:06) goal I think it's always going to help you uh be better at what you're doing and staying focused on what you're doing instead of just having that lack of days ofal mindset of just getting in I gotta work I got to do this I got to do all that you remind yourself why you're here and what you're doing it and it's gonna have a better result for sure yep and then we going need low emotional state we often get tired and it won't work like we did so this is basically just something to ground that to I do this
(06:30) myself and I think we'll keep on doing this basically every Friday to add stuff next week we'll talk about a checklist a little bit so if you guys like it feel free to comment or something particular would like to see if this is of value to but appreciate it and we will talk to you guys next time



(9) Episode #5 - Newby Tries to Learn SPX Volatility Chart - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6a8ASFnSsV8

Transcript:
(00:00) because you'll remember it better by you doing it go here um so let me refresh it real quick yeah so I remember uh wait let me go here display price so yeah I remember and then the standard deviations yeah so I remember like if we were talking about you know selling a put um buying a put yesterday and how you kind of want to stay in between the different standard deviations so what do the standard deviations mean do you remember that um the standard deviations is basically like how far like you want to stay
(00:48) within like how far it can drop and how far it can rise is that correct yeah so I think the thing to think of with the standard deviation is so when we're looking at op options you're you kind of aware that like options are priced yeah so there's there's a pricing formula that determines the price of an option okay and all of the variables are fixed except for what's known as implied volatility and basically what volatility is is it's the move up or down of the stock market that market participants
(01:23) have voted on so the volatility of the market is the one variable that we don't know so in regards to that that means that's the one we pay the most attention to because that's essentially where it is and I think you've heard about me talk this before there's implied volatility minus realized volatility that's Mone we make so if you see here that that em stands for the expected move and basically that expected move is the implied volatility at that current moment all right all right you can see
(02:01) that earlier in the day it's at 26 if you go further to the right hand side 23 yeah move too though right so is that is that basically saying like this was right saying the move is 26 and it went down all the way to like 89 or does that have nothing to do with it so uh you're looking you just looked at out of the money price yes so the out of the money price is all of the premium and all of the options for today Yeah so basically what that means is as the market does not move um based on the expected move the
(02:44) options value goes down over the course of the day so we have however the closer we get to the day ending what's known as expiration the more accurate options are basically priced because there there's less move move in which it could go so this is all efficient there's not really anything at the particular point of the day it's just we get to decide how we want to spread out our risk over the course of the day basically yeah so um the that uh implied move is if we you know go down 23 points and that happens like right at
(03:27) the end of day at 4M um we would still win because we're outside of that standard deviation however like what we kind of want to happen is like it goes down 10 it comes up 10 it goes down 10 it comes up 10 Ty thing it just kind of stays in the balance yeah because the more it moves up and down especially if we're trading Condors the better um it becomes so you kind of get the concept of called Decay now yeah um so basically allone options these are the Greeks if you haven't picked it up uh in Greeks are Greek
(03:59) letters that represent things so basically implied volatility is known as Vega and that's what we don't know that's the implied variable then there is one that are on the opposite side of it so it's like Delta is on the opposite of price so like your directional exposure is related to the price of SPX does that make sense all right yep and then that otm price which is that that stuff that price going away every minute that is basically what's called Theta so every minute every like day that passes
(04:31) there's like a unit of theta assigned to that so basically Theta or that otm option price is what we get paid when the market doesn't move over the course of a period and then in return to that people have what's called gamma and that's they get the move of the market so if the move is Big then they make money we lose money so there's two sides to it but you can see that we have the advantage that half the day goes by and the options are just worthless less yeah that makes sense that makes
(05:03) sense so that's empirically um what we're going for and kind of My Hope here is that when we sell like a $2 option we're selling a $2 option because targeting dollar amounts is just more efficient for us because we're we're risking the same each trade but predominantly we're just going to be around these standard deviations all right makes sense so like like you said yesterday you're trying to stay within you actually said it's better to try to stay within the plus one and the minus
(05:34) one correct yeah we're going to be around there it's not some hard rule but like being right right at the money it's gonna be kind of tough to make money and vice versa likees being honest it's going to be much harder and the reason that is is those outof the money options carry more data so that means if the move doesn't happen shortly after we put on the position those options are going to lose value a lot quicker than the options that are right at where the SPX price is all right sounds good sounds
(06:05) basically that's just like the easy rule of thumb like options kind of go there we do choose credit because in terms of a trading program it's just better but I wanted to show this it's like because when you ask oh a put's bullish it's like uh a put's more just like not bearish you know what I'm saying and a call is more just like not bullish so basically yeah and then you can see if we trade a condor we may have risk on both sides both sides however um when we trade that Condor we get double the
(06:35) credit so double the Decay so if it goes up 10 points and down 10 points that pays us really good on Condors that makes sense so every move we're making is not a drastic move basically if we're we're if we're if we're either you know selling a put or um buying a put or selling a coal buying a coal we're saying we think it could go this way but we're not saying it's going to go this way that drastically but if it does it helps us out um yeah we're more saying irregardless of what is priced in the market we think
(07:04) it's overpriced and we are fine with being the counterparty to that because we can manage our risk so we'll just say here's our max pain we you know kick rocks and come to play another day and then the other thing you can see with this is like as the market goes up and down if we enter at two or three times during the day we could just randomly get one of the better time slots when the move was like at the top of the 10 or the bottom of the 10 so basically we're shorting the volatility like we do with a condor or whatever
(07:37) throughout the course of the day however when we do that we've kind of balanced out our exposure throughout the entire time frame of the day yep yeah just a nice way to kind of think of it and I think this should help with is this like a perfect point right where I have this highlighted because SPS is at 5472 and this is like is this like a perfect spot to be in because right in between one uh plus one xpx and a negative one standard deviation that plus one and minus one is just always going to repopulate at at every 10-second
(08:12) interval how you have it set so if you click standard deviation by live if you scroll up to live and click at Market open so like that shows the SPX how it was priced in at the open that makes sense so basically now if you hover over that area that you hovered over earlier okay that may be a better spot to do it because you can see that like the standard deviation is 5490 to the upside and at the open it was 54 93 so that that may that so that may not be the best time to place it because if you would have just placed it at the open um
(08:47) you'd be three points further away you know what I'm saying because Mak sense the out ofth the- money options price went down so much that we're within what was expected it to move from the open of today all right and with this you're still with you're even more within what was expected from the move of the open at the day all right so you want to be a little bit out of it or a little bit under it not right where it's expected it's all priced in dynamically throughout the course of the day the
(09:15) concept is not because whenever we place the $2 trade or whatever that is we're always going to be around that one standard deviation on both sides at the time when we enter the main concept is that we enter multiple times of the day so we get different standard deviation ranges so if the market if we put a trade on at the beginning of the day and the market went up 20 points and then we put on another trade when the market was up 20 points we have drastically different one standard deviation lines between those two trades makes sense
(09:46) just we just get better and we just have the more we do it the better opportunity We have basically in that yeah if you think about if we it's all the same so if we flip a coin once we have a 50-50 shot and if we flip a coin five times we still have a 50-50 shot on each coin but with only five flips we could easily get four heads and one tail whereas if we do 50 flips we can get it'd be really hard to get 40 heads and 10 Tails so what we're doing is we're creating more occurrences to lower the period of time
(10:20) between when our back test matches what we anticipated makes sense and basically what that does is it makes it mentally easier our losses are much smaller so mentally it's not as diminishing and this kind of goes in with like the numbers back approach of what we're trying to do all right and so like when entering these back like when setting this up in trade Stewart like would you be setting this up like the night before saying we're GNA do it uh say we do 9:30 10:30 11:30 12:30 so we do it once an
(10:48) hour or something all right sounds good and you already put that in your AI bot so you don't have to worry about doing it day of it's just uh you already have that put in there what we did is we tested it over the period of the time learn from it and the other main concept to think too is you know the curve fitting people they'll do what's like what I call is like adding diversification for diversification sake so like let's say we trade a trade at 930 and it has like a 25% PCR and we end
(11:18) up making 10% on it you know and then let's say a trade at 1030 has a 10% PCR and you end up making 2% on it so you'd probably be better off just doubling up the size of the 930 trade versus trading 1930 and 11030 because the combined of 2 930s versus 1930 and 11030 is lower so like we don't want to diversify of something that isn't a better benefit than is currently present you know what I'm saying it only shows us to diversify if it makes sense on our back test right correct so if we look at something we
(11:53) could be like oh this performs pretty well I like this and but what we will do is it's like if we had a trade trade that had a positive return for 9:30 10 10:30 11 and 11:30 and it was better to trade one 9:30 one at 10:30 1 11:30 comparing yeah compared to trading three at 9:30 that's better because again we're flipping that coin more so instead of waiting a month till we get you know back to break even and we get enough occurrences on the back test we may only have to wait two weeks makes sense that
(12:25) makes sense and it's like like but if it is n 30 is the hottest time on our back test and it just makes the most sense let's just go ahead and do all three right there yeah we don't want to add an additional trade that doesn't benefit the portfolio so like if we added a trade because it provides diversification but it reduces the return of our portfolio and increases the draw down it obviously doesn't make sense to do that and then the other thing that I see too is people will add trades that add diversity only on the
(12:55) upside so like maybe you get a little bit higher return but it doesn't change your draw down and then in that case I don't really like that type of diversity per se because all we've done is created An Occurrence where when we want the diversity meaning when we're losing money we don't have it makes sense yeah that makes sense yeah that that that ties it all together and just helping me understand you know like how to play with this graph and the reasoning behind this graft and just like really you were
(13:26) talking about that yesterday about like putting different trades in but I didn't really understand like you know I understood like it kind of helps you if you can do it like it makes you have a little bit more diversification in your portfolio but now it makes more sense like you're finding that in the back test I forgot about like that was my big question like well how you figuring that out but the back test will show that yeah the back test and isolation shows us what trades work and then my goal here before we start making a portfolio
(13:55) is that you see how the market just randomly moves up and down yeah by how having trades that may not be the single best performing trade of the day can help our entire portfolio as a whole because it doesn't have exposure just to the one move in the first first the other thing you can see too is if you go to the beginning of the day if we would have put a trade on at the beginning of the day we had an expected move of 26 wide and we're at 40 5466 now go all the way to the right hand side of the page and then if you go to the right
(14:27) hand side of the page now our OT options price is halfed our expected move has gone down by like 40% and we've only gone up six points so basically it'd be really hard now for the trade we put on currently to also lose as the trade we put on at the beginning of the day so this is like the opposite of if we put everything on in the beginning of the day sure we'd be completely safe by now but we would have gotten screwed if the big move happened at the beginning of the day so that's kind of like a
(14:56) reflection of eventually what the portfolio would do do um and we're just playing this and the thing is it's it's efficient it's priced in every day and since we're trading the SPX there's not that much speculation in it because it's not Nvidia and people don't think it's going to go up 300% it's just the overall stock market and what the stock market does is if Nvidia is doing great they buy more Nvidia and they sell Intel so like the S&P is always rebalancing on
(15:21) what's hot and what's cold which further mutes how much it could potentially move as well yeah so it balances itself out because the stock Market's balancing itself out B yeah and that's effectively what we're doing we're like indexing options in the index you know what I'm saying like we rebalance our volatility exposure every hour or so which makes it less likely that we get you know something happens and then on top of that we use a stoploss so like if the exposure does move we say hey it's
(15:50) not worth it we're here to find another day we're going to trade in 45 minutes perfect that makes perfect sense yeah it really does um and like yesterday wasn't yesterday a really big move in the morning yeah right when we talked it like tanked down and the other thing to notice is too is if you see like when the market goes down the pla line which is the option price spikes up so people are afraid of the downside so the expected move gets bit up when it goes down so like that sucks for us when we're
(16:20) already in a trade but it's good for us because people will be willing to pay us more in the future um because they're more fearful of the downside because that's in the current move whereas when the market goes up that black line comes down quicker so it's that's why selling puts is usually just better because people are willing to pay more for insurance to the downside than they are to be greedy people are willing to protect what they have more than they want to get what they can like this dip right here like these
(16:51) two dips like this one is at a 100 that almost is like what it was at the start of the day yeah it was an hour later however we're not going to be able to predict that orever figure that out we'll probably just get lucky like it'll probably it just balances out over time that we'll get some good spikes and some bad spikes but in general the market going down and volatility coming up is good for us because people become more fearful and then they're willing to pay us more yeah so that's why you say puts
(17:18) are so well because like you just said not trying to repeat what you just said but like this makes sense when you're looking at this graph these people are willing to pay a lot more um when it's starting to down yeah because people want to not get fired that makes sense okay


(9) Episode #6 - Newby Learns Back Testing and Inputting in Trade Steward - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QjRlnL1AyEw

Transcript:
(00:00) wanted like uh so in regards to this before uh go up to the top and click new back test now click SPX dailies under dates it's right by Co crash yep I clicked it SPX daes your computer may be Li clicked it and changed the date okay yeah so you see how that changed to 516 2022 yeah yeah yeah so that means before that we only had 3 days of expirations per week so that means we were only able to create like basically half as many occurrences all right that make sense yeah Okay now click back on the regular back
(00:46) test you canc this yeah just cancel so when we scroll back down to those annual metrics so we would anticipate that the Max draw down or return is just going to be much more volatile in 2020 2021 until it hits 2022 yeah because the amount of days that we were able to sell like we weren't able to flip the coin as much and also if like Monday was a bad day to trade but Tuesday was a good D day to trade we didn't get to trade Tuesday so the thing is with 2020 and 2021 I don't want to see a trade that
(01:24) does not work that's not okay but you can see that the returns don't look very good in 2020 or 2021 that that's fine because they're still positive yeah you know and also if you remember what happened in 2020 the world went down so I would expect a put when the volatility index goes from 13 to 80 would not perform very well yeah you know so we're like this is we're fine with this but if those were negative in 2020 and 2021 we wouldn't touch it so these were negative returns Well yeah if
(01:58) there was no green if there was no green it was just red so that's how so yeah they had big draw Downs yeah they had big draw Downs that that's kind of just a function of we couldn't flip the coin as much yep makes sense and uh so when you go to the dailies it'll kind of automatically tell you where this started becoming a pretty good return smooth out the return a little bit and the other thing we want to pay attention to is 2024 because in 2024 the volatility index which is the vix the thing that's shown in that zero GT chart
(02:26) is really low so there were a lot of Trades that worked well when the volatility was high and now no longer work so this this looks good across the board okay awesome yeah now the next thing here is you can see that the draw down is relatively large and even though this pays really well the M the Max uh risk ratio right there is not super high like our risk reward that's B this is basically twice as good of a trade as the S&P all right all right so what do we know about the standard deviation range if we're losing on a put the market can
(03:01) only be in one place at one time correct yeah so if we added a call to this it could potentially increase our return because it doesn't use any more buying power it could lower our draw down and it could raise our Max average risk ratio you know what I'm saying right now the question is like okay let's add a call to this and see how it goes so click new back test and then go add leg ad leg where's that uh it's right below the by oh ad leg ad leg okay now you're going to sell a call and buy a call that
(03:42) matches the exact same I call them mechanics of the but so it's the um so obviously not a d it's a dollar it's a premium yeah fixed premium1 so actually X out that that buy call cancel it the buy call and then click the chain link on the cell call and then UND lock yeah undo the lock that little green lock on the right okay perfect now just copy the uh put side all so $1 and and then with calls remember it's above the price so you don't put a minus in front of it okay now scroll down keeps scrolling down we're still
(04:27) going to do one lot so it doesn't use any more buying power it's still going to be the same time it's still going to be the same VIX Index scroll down scroll down scroll down and then here click leg use leg groups so even though we're entering this as a condor uh under leg groups scroll up oh use leg Yeah use leg groups okay now Title One put and Title One Call so group name one put yeah just you don't have to put one put but just say put and then group name call and then click the little golden down thing to
(05:06) for the calls to be under the calls so basically what we've done here is this is a condor but we're managing each side separately so we don't want to like lose on the call we don't want to waste money on slippage buying back the call side like when it's basically going to be worth nothing you know what I'm saying is this what the guy's talking about in the um the academy the the when a talking about portfolio management when you can manage a condor you manage so we're trading a condor but we're
(05:36) choosing if we want to manage as a condor or we just want to manage each sprad individually so in this instance we're going to manage the put spread and the call spread but since it's free buying power we're just going to trade it as a condor you know what I'm saying because we want to see if by adding the call it improves our 19 Grand 7.6 1.
(05:54) 4 basically now scroll down so on the stop loss on the put we're still going to be 700% that's all fine scroll down to the call then on the call put 500 percent now use intermittent stops right use zero DT intermittent stops because we're trading there and then do nbb minus trades minus only yeah minus only yep okay now scroll down everything else looks good same commission we're capped uh get rid of use yeah it's fine use M Max fine now run it now we'll wait a little bit so so a thing to remember I'll usually write it
(06:43) down on a piece of paper is so 19 Grand if we make more money than 19 Grand and we have less of a draw down than 5.2 it make sense to sell the call you know what I'm saying yeah oh what what am I wrong here you do not have sufficient to execute the trade 100 Max one contracts sell call buy call sell put byut movea um click on new back test scroll down it's got to be a buying power thing uh just add a zero to the 50 and see what happens so 50 Grand 500 Grand and that should do it now click run I think it's still not going to work
(08:02) yeah um just hit the back button let's retry this right here yeah and then it'll take you the original back test again okay now try this again new back test now add leg add leg or chain it you're going to chain it to the call oh yeah unclip it yeah and then sell call buy call and then right here premiums $1 and 100 and then um starting funds good there 932 use leg groups where's oh use l groups and then this one U put call Bam Bam and
(09:07) then that's fine stop 500 yeah and then make sure you click zero Day Z inter minute and then bam and then commission fees are all good that's all good slow pict is all good oh yeah run this again actually oh you know what get rid of use Max premium that's what it up just cancel you probably have to rein okay there we go now run it so the reason that happened is you put a dollar so you're telling options to Mega pick the one close to the dollar and basically it chooses too many that are like a125 makes sense that's what it
(09:51) up okay so now like I usually get a piece of paper write it down 19k 7.6 1.4 and you'll also see here I guarantee you the win ratees go down but we'll make more money so this is kind of like the time velocity of money concept whereas the faster we turn the money over meaning we're collecting twice the premium it makes sense to trade it you know what I'm saying so we can sell prium the better test of this would be due to the Condor but manage the Condor separately so see this so like our capture went down our win rant went down
(10:22) but we made only went down two% we made freaking $113,000 extra so yeah so maybe save this one and call it Connor practice Condor or something you know what I'm saying yeah um create new back test oh create new back test and then you'll save this under Connor LTR dude so can I ask you one thing this is kind of a a rookie question but uh so this is the ending Capital after the year correct well this no it's a four year long back test so this after four years four years all right makes we would we would probably not continue to
(11:05) trade a one lot after it was winning for so long you know what I'm saying we just used a one lot because it gives us a better Assumption of what we should expect all right all right all right okay so now this where I think this will confuse in trade Steward so now let's go to trade Steward and think if you wanted to program this trade what would you do yeah this is gonna be a good one um all right so let me go in here and is there any way I can like just completely refresh this to where I don't have to go
(11:33) in here and redo all the legs and stuff or no no um yeah you can just go create new bot but it's always it's always gonna copy all the legs like if you go okay yeah if you go create new and then Connor never turn on and everything's put it in your strategy yeah your Connor never turn on yep okay so now if you wanted to program this trade how would you trade it how would you program it all right um You just want me to go step by step is what you're trying to say yeah you're gonna screw up but um I'm gonna be
(12:16) surprised if you figured it out uh you have to think critically it's a trick question I'm gonna go SPX yeah and then I'm going to go condor four legs all this crap doesn't really matter right nope nope you're wrong so if you think about it we're trading a condor because it gives us buying power relief but we're managing each side separately so so we're trading a vertical spread correct so it's still fine to call it $1 Condor put side $1 Condor call side however how we want the
(12:55) bot to manage it if you go back to the back test is two you you look at Exit you see the exit see how they're split so this on options Omega basically just created two trades and one back test that's sick that's sick all right so this is like you know we had one trade now we have two trades in one trade and then this will eventually go into portfolio so if we're making like frogs this is like step one to making a portfolio yeah yeah all but we're managing them separately into portfolio correct correct the only
(13:33) reason it's a cond door is because we have free buying power and the reason we ran in the back test is because we don't want to like export this to Excel and then input a formula to figure out how they matched every day the software just does that for us makes sense makes sense man all right dud it's just like SDR and like think about the put in the call or like an Outreach email and like for however many Outreach emails you send you should be able to get X most booked yeah that makes sense man yeah helps me out a lot to understand so
(14:07) that's so you put it in as a condor um to you said to increase this is two different trades this is not putting in as a condor options Omega is just able to test two separate trades as a condor so it just gives us the math information quickly all right so don't even think about this as a condo to separate trade you're going to manage them as two separate trades and you're entering them in two separate trades correct awesome whereas if you go to new back test to help you show the other way uh click new
(14:38) back test now just click iron Condor strategy select strategy just click iron Condor yeah and then just run it just click run and just go year to date actually it'll go quicker if you already clicked run it's a big deal um let me see uh YTD is right under dates it'll just do the back test quicker so we're not going to save this I'm just trying to display it quickly but you can see here that when the Condor populates in the back test it'll show it as a condor so see how in this one it just
(15:17) has the exit on one yep and dud we got freaking screwed on this one yeah but you could see how this trade is you know not as good as managing each side or whatever and also the thing see with people is like if we're managing a four-leg trade the slippage is going to be higher than if we manage a two-leg trade so this is kind of like a money hack on like oh we can make more money by losing less money to slippage whereas like in a lot of people that are unexperienced in back tests they'll use the exact same
(15:47) slippage which is not going to happen in real life it's like the fruit rollup Rice Krispy treat example we talked about yeah um so now you can just go back we're not going to save this go back but now if you see this trade like this is two vertical spreads it's not a condor the software just allows us to trade two vertical spreads in one test that makes sense all right all right so now if you were to program this we're going to go vertical spread number of legs but four right um then everything up now why would we have four
(16:22) legs in a vertical spread so it' be two you will yes but you're not not understanding it so I'm asking like you know what I'm saying like why would we have four legs in a vertical spread um because we're managing two different ones on here right but you're inputting them as separate vertical spreads so like if you have four legs how would that be a vertical spread you sell a put buy a put where are your other two legs um it would be sell a call buy a call correct but we're not trading a
(16:57) condor we're trading a vertical spread all right so and also to reiterate this go to trade type where's trade type at there where it says vertical spread so click uh single or click vertical spread and okay well usually it will autop populate to two legs so it usually does I I chose I chose four So Okay now click Condor and see if it automatically populates to four legs yeah yeah okay so that that's like you know trade Steward is smart enough to know to not give you four legs but this is an important factor like I was
(17:41) trying to do this to confuse you so let's not move on until we get this like does that make sense that even though our back test had four legs we were just using two different back test two different trades in one back test yeah that makes sense yeah and it it makes sense that you're going to go manage them into that portfolio list too even though cuz what helps me make sense is they're in they're in order there're one's a put and one's a call that helped me like we group named them so that
(18:05) means they're two different tests and it shows it on the back test whereas when we did the back test of the Condor it showed it as a condor yes all right I see what you're saying so be confus you know what I'm saying yeah it is confusing it is confus that was the point yeah so on the trade type what do I trade then is it a vertical spread or is it a custom then it's two vertical spread all right how do do I how do I make it to where it's two do I do just do four legs or no you you'll just have to
(18:37) create a new trade so you would just title this one like 932 Condor put side and then it would be 932 Condor calls side you know what I'm saying all right all right that makes or you could just call it 932 vertical vertical call spread 932 vertical foot spread it it's whatever you want to call it again I'm further along so I'll call it a condor um but you can call it anything you want whatever helps you best practices call it a vertical spread one vertical spread two be or like put call or put side so
(19:11) the way to think of it is like we're trading a condor but we're managing each one as a separate trade yeah because a condor is made of what two vertical spreads except we're just managing them separately so we are trading a condor we're just treating each one individually makes sense so only way you could be able to manage it if you create two different ones in as well but the the reason this is benefit to us because again when we did the back test we make twice as much money for the same amount
(19:41) of capital exactly that makes sense we made 13,000 extra yeah I want to make an extra 13 Grand Conor yeah I want to I think so then so this one will just run as the put side um so we're gonna put a put a short and then uh let me see so Target $1 and Max width uh it's going to be a negative [Music] 100 100 and then size ratio one exact zero and then hey on this so you don't I didn't need to put that yeah and then see how it also says on the spread leg so like the spread leg is the the one that you buy because the vertical
(20:47) width between the short and the long yeah yeah so that that one's always going to be lank uh never going to be filled in because we're selling makes sense and vertical widths 100 yep size ratio one days exporation zero scroll down how big how many lots are we trading the quantity one yep and then uh what were the days on this one time yeah it is every day daily daily 9:32 um3 two and then all um and then what's your end time you got to Define it usually just have like five minutes because oh five minutes yep yeah
(21:36) remember you saying that yesterday um 37 where'd she go there you are and then I like the stack the no position because that's just a redundancy to make sure a bot doesn't go haywire and trade our entire account and then entry speed since we're trading zero day we're always Turbo Turbo awesome yeah like it's zero days fast trade exit we don't have any we don't have a profit Target we have a stop so what type of stop are we using we're using a um what was it it was a stop loss um 700% so it's a percent
(22:21) stop um percent loss right and then that's going to be is it so can't remember yesterday did we do this as a negative or you just do 700 just regular 700 and then you're going to use broker resting broker resting that means it's just at the broker you could read that but we we're not gonna mess you with the bot algo yet and then you're going to do uh short only because we're we're only going to manage short leg the 100 wat is you know it's dead to us a long leg yep and then uh stop leg only
(23:00) sop based on and then there's an injy filter on this right yeah there's uh um the stop loss uh inam minute stop what's what's the entry filter oh yeah um is it the vix on move down so Pro program that in remember these are tricky because there's Max men and then go way so um yep so it's the men down 0.
(23:36) 25 when so down the down the down is why do you think it's Min minimum price to enter what does price have to do with anything oh hold on my bad so it's going to be other the entry filters where is oh entry filters all right and then turn off the minimum price enter let me read what this says um Vicks moved down so one day is it the is it the

(00:00) to the portfolio we'll kind of talk about this but essentially all the edge and zero DTE it comes from what's called arthritic vers geometric mean and basically what that is is like when you compound like a hundred bucks a day like you just make a 100 bucks a day statically that's called a um arithmetic mean so make a 100 bucks make a 100 bucks make 100 bucks at the end of the week you have 500 bucks but then there's basically what's a geometric mean and that basically means means that you make
(00:31) like 100 101 10150 and then that just continues to be a bigger and bigger pot and also like you can have trades that don't really make money but it prevents you from losing like you only lose $200 in a day yeah like 800 and therefore that compounding just keeps going so you're literally just playing like this basis point math equation times you know what I got from your nav talk you talked a lot about that in that and that was making sense I was like I was understanding like you're talking about
(01:03) you know the benefits of zdt is like I saw it was compounding and you know being able to maintain your Edge and rebalancing that's what it was it was compounding and rebalancing that's how we're like able to like basically be better than the competition and just the traditional head funds yeah and like basically if we can make a percent a week and we never take a hit bigger than like 10% yeah say will aim for 5% but we're going to get more than that just because we're not going to execute like that and we
(01:36) just know we can actually execute our back test like you're doubling your money every year and a half at a 30 something percent rate of return that's wild and that's really going to start to pick up so it's everyone's trying to find like these magic strategies or whatever it is but it's like I'm trying to show people this is like the buy and hold of the S&P but with options yeah and do this through doing it every day with zero day duration and then we can actually quantify what our risk is plus
(02:06) or minus you know 30 bucks in slippage for some days on a day-to-day basis and therefore we can now leverage money so as long as we're responsible we can leverage more whereas everyone just looks to leverage first not leverage responsible so yeah so a great example of this like uh yesterday I was talking to a family member and they were talking about how somebody you know took 100,000 put Nidia and they won you know they got like 250 out of it I was like oh that's great and but since me and you talking
(02:35) about it I feel like a lot more educated in the sense of like that's great and all but he could have also lost that 100,000 because Nvidia could have just D he could have got in at a bad time and and just plummeted and then he would have just lost his butt on that rather than if you do something like zero day where you're like we talking about we're just continuing doing day to back in a year and a half he could have had 30% he could have gained 30% of that another year and a half it would have been
(02:58) another 30% and you just continue income it's different you know because like you know speculative I don't want to call it speculative especially like if he's buying stock that's really not that speculative um where it's buying an option on Nvidia that's speculative so those are two different things but yeah that's basically the Cadence is like we're just slowly chipping away and like we can automate this and the data is relatively cure uh clear and if we do it every day we'll basically get there I
(03:28) guess what my point of that is if I was an investor and if I'm going to invest my hard ear money I'm going much rather invest it in something like zero day because it's so dayto driven rather than speculation of saying oh Nvidia is rising I think it's going to rise to a th000 and it's at 500 now I'm just gonna just gonna dump my money into it and see you know like not saying that you can't make a little bit money in this but this seems like not guaranteed but just a lot more makes a lot more sense rather than
(03:57) just doing normal St yeah and the other thing too is like a lot of Investments have a very long time frame so like in Zer DT we're going to know for good or not in a couple months because there's EXA it's rolling over so much whereas a lot of people will buy like real estate or they'll just buy the NASDAQ and that strategy has worked amazing since 2008 and every time it goes down 30% in 2022 or 2020 it rips back yeah however like that time frame just really long like 2000 and 2009 granted that's kind of
(04:29) cherry picking like the top of theom bubble the bottom of the 2008 crisis but at the same time like you lost 35% after inflation over the course of that decade and it's like don't remember that far back or people don't remember like when everyone lost their ass in real estate because in real estate if you buy a bad purchase in real estate it's like it's G to take probably a decade till the market rolls over to that actually being bad you 100% yeah so people think they're smart and they do this and then
(04:59) they use Leverage and they get hit whereas like zero DT is the opposite of that like you're going to get instant feedback and you're use leverage that's going to amplify the pain or the pleasure so it's like it's not the it's the deep end of investing but once you can swim you can get across the pool yeah like I I look at as like back testing is what really takes it to a whole another level investing because you can say like here's the data that some like I feel like everybody would be
(05:26) a lot more um willing to invest in stuff if like you had a back testing for Real Estate if we had back testing for all this stuff like back testing is like hey I can put I can practice I can practice this I can um like you're talking about break this down not make manufactured Edge but just continue to add more miscellaneous into it so it's an actual true Edge we can see what the edge really is going to look like and like I think that's what really stands us out but yeah I think that listening to those
(05:53) really helped me understand like what you're talking about we're going to dive into back testing today understanding like there's a reasoning behind like each number that we put in you know there's like there's a reason why you put in slippage to I think you said you only do like uh a 1.
(06:10) 5 in slippage and you only do one trade lot and stuff like that and didn't remember your reasoning behind those because there's just a lot to take in but like it makes sense that that we're acting out of Reason in everything that we're doing you know yeah okay so let's get you kind of set up with what we'll be doing here so we'll basically have have you get rolling on this yeah so like first step is we'll kind of just go over zero DT and stuff so I am going to have you back test different amounts of premium and
(06:46) the first thing I kind of want to want you to understand is that basically this is calculating the expected move at zero DT so basically it'll show a couple metrics it shows the S&P 500 price or the SPX which is the SPX expected move which is how much it could go up or down that's basically the only variable that's not known that prices the options which is implied volatility so this is effectively what we're selling when we're selling credit then we have the vix which is a rough proxy for the
(07:14) volatility but it's calculated on a 30-day period so we don't give a huge barometer to that and day-to-day based on what's happening in the market the EM could be priced over that then we have the total out of the money options price otherwise abbreviated at otm options price and that's basically saying the value of all the options throughout the course of the entire day um and it gets updated and then we have the expected moves it has here one standard deviation and two standard deviations the one
(07:41) standard deviation move reflects what will be within 68% of your occurrences and the two standard deviation deviation move reflects what's within 95% of occurrences so I know we're choosing like $1 premium $2 premium and it probably doesn't make sense why we sell that or why the data comes up in certain ways on back test so this is a really good way to basically iterate what that looks like so if we look here at the market open the expected move was um between 5479 and 5440 however over the course of the day
(08:14) like if we look now at you know 120 Eastern the expected move is now 5477 to 5441 so it's basically not Chang the entire day but you can see here that the price at the open was 5460 and the price now is 54 uh 54 so basically this shows throughout the course of the day that when we sell premium at different times we're just creating more occurrences and balancing out the level of what's going so like volatility could be overstated from the open till the close in which case we're going to lose on our open
(08:55) trade with our stop loss however if we caught the high or the low just kind of randomly when we were selling additional trades volatility can be overstated from the open to the close but from the time we entered in at 11 or 123 year whatever that is it could not be overstated from that period forward and we could win and this is why going back to the concept we're going to choose what's called a credit Target so if we sold you know a 10 Delta which is the 10% chance at the open since there is $63 of out- of the
(09:26) money options price we make it a $150 whereas at1 like now that there's only $22 of option price we may only get 50 so basically we lost on the open trade and then we won on the trade at 130 we could have matched the probability of 10% when we ended up losing money so we're basically going to choose like a dollar or two and whatever we do that through back testing and we're just going to use a stop loss on it because a trade at the morning you know the market may have to move 20 points for it to get
(09:56) stopped but it's not going to be something we hold to ation the heat on a move that we get up or down by 10 points is probably going to be relatively similar throughout the course of the day so we're basically seeking to try and find like some premium whether it's a dollar $2 $3 that works basically at all times throughout the course of the day and then that has a relatively same win rate so if we were to sell 150 at the open each side and we sold 150 at noon on each side let's say they both roughly
(10:26) have a 75% win rate that's perfect whereas if we sold $3 at the open and it had a 75% win rate and we sold $3 at one and it had a 65% win rate we don't want to do that so we want credits to match win rates to roughly match um and then we're going to get the rudimentary data from this freeb exting software that anyone can basically use um it's for a zero DT automation so basically what you're going to do is you're going to click I'll send this to everyone you're going to to build your
(11:00) own back test and then basically what you're going to do in here is we'll just get the rudimentary data here so we'll start out with 1-1-2020 and we'll basically go to today we will exclude fomc meetings basically here this is our Target Premium so we're just always going to use a Max okay we're always going to use 100 wides spreads yeah and then basically what I want you to do is I want you to go from $1 all the way up to2 50 okay and you'll go in 25 cent increments yeah and basically what you'll do is you'll test
(11:37) all a 2X stop and then you'll test them all at 9:33 okay all right so basically this is a fix contract you'll just put in 50 Grand because that's the size of your account we're using $2 for commissions $1 for fee open slippage will be 10% closed slippage will be 15 okay okay and then basically all you have to do and then we're going to do this by put some calls in both so you'll just record this in an Excel spreadsheet let's say you go calls you click run test and then basically you'll just
(12:15) record win rate PCR and Max draw down okay yep and basically what you'll do is so that was 250 you'll do let's say Two Bucks Run It and then again you'll record win rate PCR Max draw down and you'll basically do this from $250 to a dollar going down by 50 Cent you do it separately for calls separately for puts and then you'll do both which would be the Condor so if we did this for the Condor boom and then you'll record this so basically go down by premium on two starting at 250 all the way down to Z
(12:56) obviously do like 50 cents right stop and all the call side all the put side and then you'll do both of them combined together um and then if you want you could do like a one and a half X and a 3X so if you wanted to do that on all three iterations that'll be good and you'll just record the numbers in a spreadsheet okay so just sheets and then once we have that information this one goes quick we'll kind of be like okay we want to sell $150 at the open on the put side and a dollar on the call side then we'll
(13:28) take that input options of me and we'll start to test more particular ranges and the back test just takes longer and we'll get a little bit more granular data so once you do this you can kind of understand not what's the best trade but what's the best trade that works over periods of time so you may see that you'll sell a $2 put like a $2 put is the most optimal and a $1 call is the most optimal however it's Condor if we sold a $2 put and a $150 call that actually gets us the best return so so
(14:00) this is this one that's what we're going to do in because this one it doesn't really have the Condor but that's what we're going to do in options omegas which when you have both it's trading it as a condor but yes so call spread put spread both as a vertical Condor with both of them and once we have the data of what works on each side we now have the initial building block to decide okay we know what's most optimal on the put side we know it's on the call side now what combination of the premium we
(14:29) collect on the put and the premium we collect on the call makes the best contor that makes sense that makesense probably basically going to be the same but now we know what the risk is for that then once we have that trade we say this is our 930 trade and then from that point forward we're going to say okay do these same premiums that we collect work at 10 11 noon 1 and two and then we're g to kind of see which Condors work best at those times and then we have the other building block of those other
(14:57) trades or what premium Works throughout the course of the day and then we can say okay how do we want to allocate our portfolio so again back to sports this is practice we're taking shots then we're going to start taking shots in a game after we do this so this will basically give us the initial intro to what we're looking for and then we'll go ahead and program this in trade Steward and then we'll basically come in here every day and just type you know today's the 255th so we go 620 well this won't
(15:20) show up because it was 23 2024 and then we' basically show that and we could run it and then we just come in here each day we say okay on Monday the call lost and we say is this match what popped up in trade Steward and then all of a sudden we've made the building blocks we've made the portfolio we have our assumptions we measured our assumptions daily if they're off we iterate on it and we keep on going so what people often will do is they'll put a trade and and they'll see it has a good return for
(15:53) like four years and then they'll start running the trade and they'll just be like ah I'm not I'm not making money  this I'm going to find a new trade well we don't care about that we just want to match what the trade is so we're not necessarily going to find what's been best the last year we want to see what's worked for a long period of time and then you know here it'll show like Max days to recover from like your draw down so like if we do a test and we see that outside of the co crash because the
(16:17) co crash is probably going to be we could kind of eliminate that because that doesn't happen very much it's good to know but um so once we know that we can basically be like okay this strategy could potentially lose for 60 days in a row yeah so I'm ready to run this for two months and as long as it match the back test like I'm all good and that's gonna come back eventually right start winning the important part is that we're working out not that and we're tracking our progress not that we're getting a
(16:46) sixpack you know what I'm saying yeah yeah yeah and then do you have any questions particularly around this or does that kind of empirically make sense that does make sense yeah okay to get the raw data which is eventually going to lead to building a portfolio and Auto it live yeah that makes sense and um for the purpose of just this are we just trying to figure out what are uh what Condors to build are we also figuring out hey maybe the Condors they because we've shown you've showed me in the past
(17:12) that the Condor is not the best method either so it's like we're figuring out maybe we just do you know sell a put so uh buy you know buy a call type thing you know so that's why we're testing the put side and the call side separately and then them combined because if the put Side by itself makes just as much money and has less of a draw down or less days between new netl highs we're just going to use the put you know what I'm saying because it's less risk right yeah yeah I mean there's there's no point of selling the
(17:41) other side if it doesn't help us makes sense all right sounds good that's why so This Is Us figuring out all that basically yeah but most likely what I would assume the puts are going to outperform the calls so these three time slots will probably all be condors and then we'll probably add in a specific time that only sells a put so that will be more how we balance it out rather than deciding whether we do a put or a call you know what I'm saying y sounds good but the more important part is we
(18:08) would potentially sell $2 on the put side $150 on the call side like something like that and now would make a better Condor but it's almost since we're trading it every day I can guarantee you I've done like a million back tests it's going to make sense to trade the call makes sense yeah um if anything it even if it doesn't make money it'll reduce our Max days between new n highs because if you're doing a put and a call the price of the market can only be in one place at a time yeah
(18:37) so when you're losing on a put you're most likely winning on the call and then sometimes you'll win on a put but you could have won on a put an or call so that's kind of G to be why it works makes sense makes sense and then did you have any more questions or you make sense on the yeah this makes sense yeah this is kind of putting it all together understanding like the reasoning behind the trades and how do you figure out what to trade and you know what do you figure out what even to put into options
(19:03) Omega so this makes good sense correct okay um I think that was pretty good awesome man so I'm going to stop this

Transcript:
(00:00) reading this the other day I felt like this was Chinese like I don't know why I just with all these trades right here it didn't really make much sense to me but now I was reading it I understand like all right these are like so I'm just gonna you stop me when I'm wrong but I'm just going to tell you my thought process I looked at 9320 DT a put side $2 and then there's also call side $1 and 20 are these two connected and this is one trade and are and this low premium and a low premium that's another
(00:32) two trades right but they're not connected these are the only two that are connected right correct and I know it's kind of confusing but it's like they are two separate trades but they use the same buying power you know what I'm saying so like they're you could see their p&l they're managed completely separate they are yeah but they in turn use the same buying power so they're they're pair they're two separate trades paired with one another all right they're two separate
(01:05) trades PA like so yeah these are two this is is this a condor is my question it's a condor but it's managed individually as ver yes so it's a condor but this is managed as the put side and this is managed as the call side correct correct all right all right so going into this I haven't put it into groups yet in option Omega that was you already answered one of my questions so we are going to group this named the same you know what I'm saying 932 AO but we distinguish them call and put Perfect
(01:37) all right that makes sense yeah I remember you showing me that so I was going to ask that so did I enter so this is I did a I'm trying to do a year to date so I just did one one 2020 to now 2024 here today but yeah so it be six six click your to date YTD up top and it'll automatically populated yeah there you go Oh I thought it was uh I thought you had to put start dat as 2020 for year to date that's how we do back test the like long dated but so we don't have to wait 120 seconds on the call we'll just run a
(02:14) shorter period you know what I'm saying I see what you're saying I see what you're saying that's why I sent you the trade automation toolbox thing because it gives you the results like that all right all right makes sense um all right well so I did xpx is the ticker of course um Iron condor fixed premium um that's all looks good right correct correct yep yep I get the sell put $2 zero DT um by put again all one quantity 100 wide so 10 correct yeah and then we also want those green locks to
(02:52) be unlocked because that means it will only take it at 100 wide you know what I'm saying all right makes sense and also where you've been a to say here is the width of that spread is going to be points so it's not 10 points wide it's 100 it's 10 grand of risk not one so it's 100 yeah and if you look at the trade Steward shows that 100 wide yep all right I thought it times it by 10 on this that's why I was I guess I was guessing well 100 is Times by 10 it's $10,000 buying all right see
(03:27) what you're saying you're taking $200 of Premium two times you're using $10,000 buying power 100 time 10 10,000 I mean 100 time 100 10,000 y makes sense and then so same thing for here 120 put side because I was looking at you did on the minus and the plus so you remember that yep and um 75 that you just you corrected my I had it at 7.
(03:55) 5 but you corrected it so 75 um everything looks good there correct yep all right so this is where I was getting the concept of that I get the 50,000 starting funds do we do 100% margin okay so we're doing 100% margin but we're going to override it with our contract size so like if we did 10% margin it wouldn't trade two trades or if like we took a loss or two during the back test it may flip from one trade to two trade you know what I'm saying so like in trade Steward how many contracts are we traded for this trade two two so
(04:29) that means you're going to want that 100% margin but you're going to put Max contracts per trade it too and what this does is if we go down 10 grand or up 10 grand it won't make it a three lot or bring it down to one lot so we'll get the consistent time results all right see I put contracts but I didn't go back to the the margin thing so like this is a 50 Grand account and we were using 100% of our account how many contracts would we actually be trading uh one contract 100% of 50 Grand how much buying power
(05:03) do we use per trade oh I see what you're saying yeah five and then if we went on a winning streak and we got to 60 Grand it would start selling six contracts if we went on losing Street and Dro below 50 it would start selling four contracts which then would have different size we'd sell six one day four one day so now our results are different because we're trading bigger on different dates oh all right so if by so if I had zero here this would be five contracts this is automatically saying I'm doing five cont
(05:30) contracts but if you lost it would go to four and if you won and got to 60 Grand it would go to six oh all right all right makes sense so now that we're just trying to do fixed contracts but we use the 100% margin because we know we'll have more than enough buying power no matter what our draw down is to do two contracts all right makes sense so the two contracts saved us for losing a crap ton basically all right well it just it just makes sure we're trading the same size every day so our numbers will be
(05:58) accurate makes sense Mak Mak sense makes a a little sense so like if this is zero right I'm trying to just understand this at the that the level you're saying if this is zero or not even I just don't put anything in here let's not say zero I don't put anything in there this would it could go up by five contracts or go downum we would start at five contracts if we got to 60 Grand it would start trading six contracts if we lost to 40 Grand it would start trading four contracts but now that I put two in here
(06:25) what does that do it's just always going to trade two whether we have a 200 Grand account or a 30 grand account makes sense yeah all right makes sense awesome so 9:32 the key concept is we're just always gonna override it fixed contract while we're actually trading that account because we want to know what our actual risk is with what we're currently doing all right sounds good that sounds good all right so 9:32 that's pretty no float or anything daily it said it on the thing this so this is the other
(06:56) thing I am I I know we always do intrate no do I do any of this yeah you're going to use the vix because we have the vix up or down filter right that's where I was trying to find so the where's the vix up or down on this trade 932 DTA click on it yeah click on it now scroll all the way down to the bottom oh all right sweet all right this is where I was missing the data then all right this makes more sense scroll all the way down scroll all the way down scroll all the way down see yep intr day greater than in yeah program that
(07:34) and so this was uh overnight Gap um overnight move so that's G be the max overnight move greater than so I'm trying to reverse this because I've if it's Max down Max what is the max overnight move down mean that means that if it's more than that number would we execute the trade or not if it's more than that number uh if it's great so if it's more than that number we would it if it's less than that number we would right like if it's more if it's negative one we would but if it's neg3 we wouldn't
(08:23) right no because what's greater than negative 25 uh negative one no negative Point .1 my bad is what I meant no negative point1 is less than negative .25 I always F this Up's closer to zero negative one or one um what's closer to zero negative one or one they're they're the same distance uh in in regards to the minus 0.
(09:01) 25 you know what I'm saying so if minus 0.25 now I'm screwed because you think about if you're negative one negative one is a smaller number than negative .25 yeah yeah yeah okay so if you're looking for we're gonna execute this trade if the overnight move is greater than negative 0.25 oh so out is negative4 greater than negative 0.25 no is 0.
(09:41) 5 greater than negative 0.25 no only 0.1 negative .1 would be right no because negative .1 is a smaller number it's further away from zero than negative 0.25 you know what I'm saying yeah so what greater than means for a negative number is anything closer to zero than that number so20 would be closer right correct but negative3 would be further away than negative 0.
(10:10) 25 from zero so we would not trade it all right all right so I'm so when it negative one Z be closer to zero yeah like negative. one not negative one that's what I was trying to say and just to take a step back here are we clarifying the numbers part or are we trying to clarify we're confused by the greater than min max at first at first I was trying to clarify the overnight and then the numbers were getting we're good on the numbers now num on the numbers okay so now this is going to be confusing so on trade Steward we have drawn the line of we
(10:50) will trade this if it's closer to zero then negative .25 yes so if we go to trade if we go to options Omega now we can see that what which one of these barometers is going to set the fact that we're closer to zero than minus 0.25 would be overnight move up right it's gonna be it's gonna be the max overnight move down so that means if we put negative 0.
(11:23) 25 in the max left overnight move down just put 0.25 they don't take negatives here so if the max move down is 0.25 because it since down that makes it the negative in options Omega makes sense yeah that's where I was getting confused so we've drawn the line minus 0.25 that's the max down anything above that Max down minus 0.
(11:48) 25 Max down minus 0.25 so anything above that we were trading it yep so basically this is the minus 0.25 anything closer to zero makes sense yeah that makes sense um awesome so we're good on that let me make sure um and then is it inra we always do the not intraday movement I got that confused with something else um now you have your stop loss which is correct yep you have your National bid best offer only that's what nbbo stands for a national B best offer so that's correct we're doing leg groups though right yep
(12:30) so um and you just got to do the put side and the call side um oh group name put and then call and then so we're going to go here here and then so but now you need to scroll down and put a stop in for the call side or the putot side whichever it's not showing um where do I where do I do that at so keep scrolling so your put Sid's already correct because you already have here's the call side all right let me see what it said in this this is the put side so you'll have to go back so all right call side was another
(13:14) 400% right awesome is it this do I need to do this again yep you're always going to be inter the best off or minus scroll down now exits nothing MK we pay to trade so we got to account for it yeah so on the commissions and fees go ahead that's a fixed cost that's how much the sibo charges us a buck yeah so how much is it on the commissions and fees I couldn't remember a dollar it's always dollar commissions is always a dollar all right I need to write that down $1 um that's one thing I forgot
(13:57) um do I need to do it per this this yeah both per contract because you pay to get in and and get and okay so this is now the important part use slippage yep okay so this probably going to confuse you so the entry slippage if you scroll up so you can see here scroll up all the way so when we get in we're shopping a twole order because we're we're selling the short and buying long we're selling so usually the bid ask is a minimum of 5 cents the SPX is liquid this is great so when we're shopping a two-leg order it's
(14:38) going to cost 10 cents to get in all right so go down to the slippage entry slippage yep hold on I'm just putting this down cost 10 cents all right and uh let me get down here um and that's conservative it's probably closer to five but so it cost 10 cents to get in yep and then stop loss slippage which is important is that gon is it gonna be scroll up yeah so when we get out of this trade we're only going to be managing the short leg because remember the long leg's dead to us once we enter yeah yeah
(15:15) yeah yeah so with this short leg if we look at the put it's only $2 right now when we enter however when we exit what's the stop loss on that $2 is it 08 is it the difference between these two what's our stop loss for the put side stop loss is uh um 400% okay so if we're four times the value of $2 what is that eight 800800 y$2 but and the other thing you need to remember of is this is It's what's called a net loss so if it's a 4X loss we've lost $800 however we entered the trade for $2
(15:58) so we're actually buying that back the contract at a th bucks does that make sense so say that one more time so if we have a 400% lost we're losing 800 bucks yeah however we collected $2 to open a trade so we're losing $800 more than $2 you know what I'm saying so yeah that makes sense when we buy it back our option's actually going to cost a th000 bucks because the difference between the 200 plus the 800 um and then rule of thumb is two two and a half perish but we'll just put 20 cents all right so
(16:36) let's do this real quick on a $2 option how much are we buying the option back for if we have a Forex loss uh ,000 correct and what around 2% what would our exit slippage be for a $1,000 contract um that's where all right so re redo that that is where I got confused I get you you have a $200 thing of Premium you have a 4X loss so you're losing 800 bucks so now 800 would be the ex exit slippage no no so we're buying so we sold $200 we lost 800 however we we also collected 200 so it's going to cost us
(17:16) ,000 at our stop loss yes and it cost us roughly 2% of that, in exit slippage so let's do this again $2 option that is a 4X stop how how much money do you lose on it 800 option Okay now what's 2% of a thousand um 2% of thousand that's freaking 20 bucks yeah so if we scroll down and this is back to Times by 100 so our exit slippage on the put side or exit slippage you just use one 20 bucks 20 bucks all right that's 20 cents because it's Times by 100 oh 26 yep okay now if if we scroll back up look at the
(18:00) call side so if you're collecting a120 and you times that by four what is that uh calculator yeah roughly okay yeah it's like 500 bucks now 500 plus a120 so it's like 620 bucks yep now repeat that now run me through it out loud but I just told you so um you're since a $120 our stop loss would be you know times that by four as well that's roughly uh 500 bucks um and then you where so on that one how did you get um 600 out of that that's where I'm confused so you're taking 480 120 Time 4 that's how much money you
(18:50) lose all right 120 Time 4 all right 480 you have to you collected 120 so what's 480 plus 12 plus 120 600 all right so now 600 times what percent is going to be our slippage 600 times um so 2% again all right so how much is that 600 times 2% is freaking uh let me do the math on that but if if a th000 was 20 cents 600's going to be 12 right yeah yeah whatever but if you scroll down that's not it'll be2 then yeah but if you scroll down we can only use one slippage on this so we're just going to
(19:36) use 20 all right sounds good now if this the stop loss always uh exit always overrides the exit slippage right uh we're not exiting this trade yeah it's only gonna it's only if we were to even put exit slippage that's just the theory of like this you get stopped out which is the 400% it's going to take 20 bucks away from us if we exited it would take nothing on this trade we're not acting so it's irrelevant sounds other thing the last thing you want to do here is see cap nonoperating losses at stop loss
(20:07) click that and basically what this does is if the price were to jump from $980 to $1,020 it would just take the, stop and add 20 cents to it rather than taking the 1020 stop and adding 20 cents to it does that make sense yeah because in real the market can jump but we're g to since we've already beat up the stop loss we're just assuming that when the trade triggers at 10 bucks it's going to send our order through and we'll just lose 20 cents which over the long term will be true but just not on a
(20:43) day-to-day basis makes sense okay now run the test okay now save this test damn this trade has been banging this year um now nvidia's got nothing on this dude um now do you remember how to save this um do I just say save right there and then and then click Conor LTR oh yeah Connor LTR and this would be con yeah YTD AI AO full condor or something and then maybe like title it like I did this one so you know which one it is okay so now you're good and now do I need to take this though like do I so save save it now in option Omega
(21:47) save and then uh actually reclick the notepad scroll all the way to the bottom share with share test with others um save now go to the paperclip in opt left left left paper clip oh my man um all the way to the left by the title of it yep you copied it now go to trade Steward and click on this yep and go all the way down down uh erase that what you have in there paste the link and then write this is the test I use to monitor day-to-day performance and then go back to options Omega and then click new back
(22:52) test and then go 01 01220 now run it and then once this one runs you'll save this one as this is my long-term expected result from this trade and you'll save it in the same area on it so basically we have two different ones to look at yeah like you won't need to do it because I already did it but basically like the long-term expected result is like the back testing that we do and then once we run it we've since we've decided to run it we already you know it has a good return so now we're
(23:30) just monitoring it to make sure it matches every day you know what I'm saying yeah can I ask you one thing I get that can I ask you one thing on the slipage one more time is it normally where did you get that 2% number again um that's just like a beat up thought of how much the slipage will be about 2% usually yeah like it'll be volatile like you make it 30 cents 5 cents but on average it's going to be around 2% now sa sounds good and save this on average sorry I'm just writing that down um on average um and then save this
(24:05) bad boy and then just going to say this is GNA be create new because you you'd override it oh yeah create new back just my bad just saying all time expected return and then save it under con LTR and make it link sharable and then bam and then write this is my long-term expected result like can I enter it down here or is it not going to let me I'm trying to hit enter um no I would I that's why I just put three hashes and then do it oh put space three hashes space and then do it and then also this may be confusing but
(25:05) it's like this is going to show you the put and the call simultaneously so if you wanted to you could link just the put side because that's what this side is going to be no yeah that makes sense but

Transcript:
(00:00) or whatever yeah so um really I was just focusing on um this the the the the spreadsheet that we went on um you want to share your screen so I can see yeah let's just dive into it um so I just I did have some questions that just arised with it all um I thought you know I kind of feel like this whole thing is continuously like realizing how much I don't know about this stuff which is good for me you don't need to know that much about it honesty um okay um so I just because I wanted to just go ahead
(00:40) and assume which ones were good um so you could tell me if I was wrong or not um but looking on this I was wondering like I you kind of answered my question earlier but I'll ask so everybody can understand like why was this so why were these Max draw Downs so crazy on this that's uh 54% right oh 54% that makes sense all right right or is it 5.
(01:12) 44 no it's 54% yeah 544 is what it and you were using the 50 Grand account right yep um so the reason those are so high is because um it's only one side makes you know what I'm saying so like if you're losing on the call side you're probably losing on the put side so the nature of these Condors is they have a relatively small stop loss B basically so for example if we're trading around that one standard deviation like we spoke last time which is like 68% of the time it's going to you know expire um out of the money which means
(01:49) we win and the other 32% of time it won't however we're using a stop loss so we limit our loss so it's going to be basically even less so if you think about it we lose more than 30% on one side and more than 30% on the other so we're going to be losing you know twoth thirds of the time however we rarely lose on both sides so the nature of this trade is it's much better at not losing money than it is it making money and then on top of that like we'll put a few filters that it's like you know if the
(02:23) volatility get smashed overnight because there's some type of you know news announcement or something that the news is basically known for what's priced and for the day we effectively are not going to trade for that day so the reason I just had you do this is we are just going to understand what's the best premium you regardless of any filters so the Max draw down will most likely come down a lot once we start to Institute a little bit of volatility or move filters but we're just trying to see whether we
(02:51) want to sell $250 C or $1 what's going to be best for us all right yeah and um so reading these Max draw down down that is like the can you just explain to me again like so I know in your terms I feel like you always do a better job of explaining it than I can read on the internet like what is Max draw down telling us again like if it's um like the percentage it's going to come back or yeah so there's basically what's known as a Max net lick or new net lick high and that's neet liquidation values your
(03:24) account value so if you started with 50 Grand and you went to 100 Grand and you took like let's say 10 % draw down that means you're losing 10 grand from the absolute Peak or 10% from the absolute Peak it doesn't mean from your initial account value it means from whatever was the highest account value you had and basically what this Max draw down is is it's basically telling us how much pain we have to withstand um in order to make our expected return so for example the annual return of the S&P over the last 20 years is you know
(03:58) roughly 10% maybe the nasdaq's like 15 yet the Max draw down was like close to 50% during covid and um I it was like 35% during Co it was like 50% during 2008 so the thing is with these options we have such a high time velocity and we play this game every day that like we experience close to our Max draw down you know every three to six months basically makes sense and so you want the Max draw down to be as low as possible obviously uh we want the return to the Max draw down to be as low as possible because the thing is with
(04:34) options we basically have an unlimited amount of access to leverage um however we need to be responsible with that so with the S&P it's currently going up right now but it's such a longer term time frame that once a decade or once every five years you take like a 35% loss so people just have a lot of recency bi with it whereas with us we're going to get that in like 90 days so we want to be conservative but also the thing with you is since we only have a 50 Grand account like even if we take you know I don't
(05:09) really want to take a 20% draw down because then we have to take get 25% to go back but like I would not hesitate one bit to size our portfolio where we get a 10% draw down I anticipate being a little more if that's what it back tested but we're not going to have to pay much of a tax if we lose 10% we need to make 11% to get back to even so it's worth the benefit of the upward compounding from the draw down so basically we're trying to get as leveraged as possible to have a projected draw down of 10% I would
(05:39) actually anticipate it coming out to about 15% and so you want our draw down just to understand like trading if your draw Downs around that 10 to 15% Mark that's usually a good spot to be at so yeah and it depends on your account size so like yeah with this account size like we're trying to produce income whereas you know if we try to keep our Max draw down to 5% like a 5% draw down on a 50 Grand can is only 2500 bucks which like doesn't hurt that much it would hurt if you had a $3 million account maybe you
(06:13) know but we we're just trying to make money with this type of account size and the tax that we pay from using that leverage with draw Downs of 10% doesn't even remotely hurt us comparative to the benefit of the compounding we get to the upside so there for like we're we're good with uh leveraging it up perfect sounds good so um can you go briefly over that makes sense then can you go brief briefly over PCR just again I know it's premium capture rate but and you kind of just told me it but can you dive
(06:46) into that again just to understand like what to tell us about the trade I guess yeah so think of Premium capture rate as like a sales funnel so if we sell $100 of Premium over the long period which again with Z DT should only be about three months we expect to keep $812 for every dollar we sell so like think about it it's like if we are doing a mailer campaign for sales with the open trade we spend $100 we sell $100 in premium we keep eight then we do like an end of the day trade which could be like LinkedIn
(07:21) prospecting and we sell $100 and we keep 5% of it then we do a you know email Outreach campaign and we sell $100 and we keep $8 of it and basically by having these different campaigns of Trades that should be somewhat uncorrelated not all related over you know even if two of the eight trades don't perform well over 90 days the other six May perform a little better and it'll effectively become random that we just end up getting around our eight to 10 percent I think that's where we'll be we'll be around 7
(07:54) and a half to 10% premium capture and another thing with the PCR is it kind of shows us the robustness of that edge so if something has like a 5% premium capture that could easily like not work over a period of time because the margins are so slim with our assumptions and then also usually like the lower stop multiple we have the lower premium capture we will also have and if we have a condor since we're selling twice as much premium and have risk on both sides we'll normally have a premium capture that is lower whereas if
(08:32) we were just selling a put we have a higher premium capture but we can double use that buying power so the I think the main takeaway is we want to balance out trades that sell a lot of Premium so we don't need as high as a PCR then we want to have trades that may not sell that much premium only on one side with a high stop and has a really high PCR and then we want to have high win rate trades and low win rate trades and basically between balancing the win rates the pcrs and the draw Downs each different styles of Trades
(09:06) pair well so you'll you'll like never find a trade that has a really high win rate really low draw down and really high PCR basically it makes sense yep so so basically just from layman's terms PCR is basically the premium that we're going to keep from each trade it's the bottom of your sales funnel it's the bottom sense you know what I'm saying yeah it's your your net profit is that necessarily thinking like almost like your net profit of Premium bottom line you know Top Line is your Revenue which
(09:32) is the premium that we sell bottom line is bottom Line's our p&l but PCR is kind of like our margin on our Top Line makes sense makes sense awesome so um basically bottom line of what we're making bottom line of what we make awesome um so was I right in guessing these or was I wrong yeah so tell me why you highlighted these ones in green for the call side the put side and then the iron Condor side yeah so again this was me not having a full understanding of the Max draw down and PCR but I was just looking at which ones
(10:10) I thought that had like the most balanced um numbers like I saw for our win weight was 73 on this one our Max draw down was a little bit lower on uh this one than all of these I guess like now coming into terms I almost would think like the 0 five might be better but we have had a higher PCR on the um on this one than I mean a pretty good PCR on this one other than these so I figured that this was just like the most balanced number on this um that's was my thought process behind that and same for the put side and same for the both I was
(10:49) just looking at like which one I felt like was balanced all around yep and then for both I see you chose $150 right why did you choose that because it was also balanced or um and let me see yeah I would I might have chose the wrong balanced one but that was my game plan is to go in and just picking the most balanced one yeah so I agree with that for a condor but then again like we're trading this the Condor for two vertical spreads and I know we kind of went through this in the last episode of recording um that you
(11:21) could link or something but basically it looks like the put side has a bigger Edge than the call side correct yes so so if we were to trade like $2 on the call side and $2 on the put side you can see that on both it doesn't really work out that well because the draw down get really big um however and this is how we programmed the original trade if we traded $2 on the put side and $1 on the call side we've like naturally balanced out the edge between the put and call while just reusing the same buying power
(11:54) makes sense yeah that's why I was going to ask on the both I didn't mean to cut you off there so the both like rep represents like the is that going to be like the average of what we put on the put in the call side cuz I was like know I understand like the $2 is uh the number amount we're putting in there for the put in the call that's where I was confused on like on the one and a half so when you choose um like a150 on both that's just choosing the put and the call that's closest to a150 however
(12:23) we're not managing this as a con managing it to Vertical spread so like this is where I see a lot of beginners screw up because they'll be like if I use a150 I make more money than if I sold $2 or $1 call and it's like yes that's true but we took the rudimentary uh you know build your own back test software that doesn't have as different functionalities and no filters where we go to options Omega we can say okay let's test $2 and $150 and then maybe let's put a filter on it and then
(12:58) when you get more granular like that you're now able to understand and make better parameters and choices within the confines of what you know is probable but we want to start with the most basic thing because we know that without a filter or regardless that between1 is going to be our fund Zone before we put on any premium makes sense and I was gonna say um is this kind of like just so I can continue to understand it is that like the difference between being a curvefit or not being a curvefit cuz like like like
(13:31) for instance with being a curve fitter in this one just saying like you're doing $150 for both instead of getting very Griner like you said and that's like the difference of like what's going to win you more money yeah I mean curve fitting is very nuanced because you can use the last 90 days and 30 days and have it work however um like we we are trying to be low maintenance and campaigns so the thing is it's like you know in the last 90 days maybe selling $3 puts and no calls at all worked well but what we're doing
(14:12) here is by having this trade that's worked for the last four and a half years and we have another trade that's worked for the last four and a half years that aren't correlated we're just saying that cyclically it's just gonna kind of balance out you know and yeah yeah we actually know what our risk is because the thing is if you did only a $3 put because it's done well the last 90 days you could you know have a back test that's like a 500% return but we know from the aggregate over a long period of time like if that
(14:43) market turns and like you take a little bit too long to decide you don't want to trade it anymore you could lose a boatload of money soes the thing is here is like like I said a lot of people would be afraid of a 10% draw down so they'll like mentally massage it by saying oh we use discretion weuse use whatever it's like the only discretion we use is in our back testing for what we think is probable and then by having it over a four and a half year period that basically prevents us from being curve Fitters because it was over such a
(15:16) long period of time from different environments and then we had you know nothing's necessarily wrong with having more than one filter on a trade but if that more than one filter drastically reduces the frequency to where there was 1,200 trading days and it only traded like 70 times then that's curvefitting whereas if we had a trade with 15 filters on it or something ridiculous this would usually never happen but it's still traded a thousand out of 12200 days then that's not curvefitting because there's so much
(15:46) frequency um of occurrence the filter wouldn't matter it's what curve fits is the filters are so specific it gets rid of a bunch of occurrences makes sense makes sense it almost like curit in putting filters in that makes your trade seem better than what it actually is

(00:00) about it it was not good but I feel like we may have had it back then also yeah I think we haven't really done it like this I think if I can remember right we haven't really done it like this okay so here we are here's your first trade I know I kind of hinted we were going to use the vix filter and we were going to do it the open um can you walk me through your thought process of why you chose this as well as starting from your original spreadsheet with like choosing different premiums and then how you came
(00:30) about for choosing this particular setup so um the reason why I chose these these premiums uh we've talked about this a little can you go back to your original spreadsheet where you like tested different premiums so like this is this where you started run me through your thought process yep so we've talked about this a little bit in the past but what we did is um we were trying to figure out what are the best premiums on the call side what are the best premiums on the put side and what are the best premiums on both sides um and so
(01:05) basically what we found out was when I ran it through the the trade pool box is that $2 was the best over here um on the put side because of the win rate and just a combination of the win rate the Max draw down and the PCR I just felt like you know that was the best uh the best one to choose for what we're trying to achieve here again we we always talk about hitting base hits and same thing over on the call side I felt like oh the $1 premium was the best uh over here just because of kind of the average all
(01:40) three of these numbers and then same for the uh $150 on both and that led me to um that led me to options Omega where um you know I was just playing around you know just because we said the $2 and the 150 weren't were the best so so it looks like you didn't choose either run me through why yeah why you didn't choose that you didn't choose the $150 which was the best Condor you didn't choose the $2 put which was the best put you didn't choose the $1 call which was the best call Yeah so basically the reason
(02:10) why I thought that was is I started playing with it I put $2 in there and I put a150 in there and when I when I I was just playing from that from basically that range um between those two and just seeing what best fit our portfolio and I felt like this one had um you know the best the best kager the best Mar and the best inning capital win percentage and average win average wins and average win per trade all just looking at all that data I felt like this fit our fit our portfol what metric do you like the most
(02:44) out of those um and why honestly I like looking at you know profit loss and um the Max draw down and the mar but for me personally I just because that you've told me that we have a um ending Capital goal of 100,000 I like looking at the ending Capital as well um because when I was I messed up a couple of these and it told me that my ending Capital was uh like 41,000 so that's when I knew I was really messing something up um and so I came back in here and I was plugging with you know the uh the move down and I
(03:24) was plugging with the slippage as well and when I came to this um I felt like this was the one that was looking the best and then uh the what really made me ultimately decide that this was the best one is when I went to trade Stewart and was matching what we had in trade Stewart as well and then that's what we want in the concept that so like you chose this for premium capture so premium capture is the premium we sell and then what we end up keeping so like basically you can see your total premium $175,000 if you want to put your cursor
(03:58) over that and then we basically collect 26 of that which equates to roughly $47,000 in profit which is their ending Capital awesome so so basically this is a premium capture trade and premium capture trades are great because it's a robust source of edge the larger the premium capture is the more margin of er we we uh have to basically run this trade and then also since it has a filter it better have a high premium capture because we're filtering out half of the occurrences of like days we could be using our money so this this money we
(04:29) will be holding for half the days when the vix does nothing just to take this good of an opportunity so it has to be good and the other thing we like with premium capture trades is like we see the mar is still good which is very important because if we have a trade that has like a onear those losses are going to hurt so bad to make you know that 25% that's not really going to be uh that appealing the other thing that's really good about this is like with a big stop even though it gives us some draw Downs it's just hard to take losses
(04:58) on both sides in the same day I run something similar to this it only happens like once a year um basically at the max and then this is just going to be like nice and robust chip away at it it's Capital efficient for us I like that we're collecting more on the put so like even though we're collecting more on the put with the way volatility is priced being that puts are priced richer than calls like work even though it's 120 and 175 like we're probably actually collecting you know you know a dollar
(05:31) you know $ two dollars of volatility risk premium on the put side and last on the call side which is basically what we want because it's more abundant on the put side so like this is more of a delta neutral or directional trade because the market if it goes up we're probably G to get hurt but if it goes down not that fast we'll probably be fine so I actually really like this trade I think this is a great trade for every everyone else to run um I also like that size that's two contracts for 50 Grand so we
(06:00) can basically start with this it'll use 20% of our or now that we have 100 Grand it's only going to use 10% of our buying power which is really good so that basically leaves us room for like you know six or seven other trades in there so like sizing is Right draw down is right this looks good it'll make us money at a two lot um basically this will do you know 15% or so so we have another 85% return that we got to fill in with other

Transcript:
(00:00) here is my spreadsheet right yep I found the call side at 330 did the best at two and then I also found a put side at 230 did the best at two just because you know just looking at all the numbers I feel like it had the best uh win rate with the best average win in premium with the best PCR and the lowest Max draw um so what I did and you I mean again correct me on everything I'm wrong definitely know I'm not an expert on this so what I did is I put the put side at two and I played with since it was weird for me that the
(00:45) call side was at too I felt weird about that um this is Max huh this is the max premium setting this is at uh let me see I had it on the prium yeah um and this is the trade I came up with though um 50 wide 50 mil 50 wide and I got a 46,000 profit loss 8.9 77% win rate 96 ending capital and total premium of 351 scroll down huh scroll down how's this doing this year problem see that oh crap um it's not consistent all right so like um we do look at the max draw down and the return and everything but it needs to perform
(01:45) so makes sense the reason why this doesn't work is that these $2 and 180 when you get close to expiration these are going to be in the money because the move's really small in the last half hour so like the slipage would be like vastly more on this so this is like an example of a test that like we use the same slippage for the entire time you know what I'm saying yeah and also like because if you had a $1 option versus a $2 option like we're assuming the same slippage which is a fair comparison the
(02:22) other thing too and you don't know this but during Power Hour these options are going to go in the money and Gamma which is the Greek that pays us that's on the other side of theta if you remember that from any of the courses you took is at its Max at the money closest to expiration so like the actual slippage if we were to trade this in real life would probably be like on average 50 cents 50 cents all right yeah because it would be even more because it's in power hour so this is like a like you would
(02:52) never know this but this is just a real trog versus what would happen in real life so usually opt for a higher premium um because that higher premium like allows us to eat less money and slippage and commissions and fees however in Power Hour the slippage is absolutely brutal when you're at the money because the market and the prices of the options move like like ludicrously parabolically quick so that was something that I didn't mention in the assumptions with what's going on and stuff so not something you'd be aware of
(03:23) but if we did this as like like the skewed Condor thing it's like that's what I anticipated want to do because skew is heightened at expiration there's more skew on the putot side than the call side so I like that part of it I would say like literally this trade at just like a dollar on the put and you know 80 cents on the call would probably be um good enough for us to do that makes sense too because if I'm looking at this one here I found a really good one just put one at a dollar yeah I was
(03:58) like this is a good Bas hit trade you know like I did see that so that makes perfect sense that you're saying that because this one caught my eye a lot to be real with you I was like man that's just a solid trade you know like yeah and the like I actually used to only trade power hour when I worked at ripling because it was just easier uh so just to give you kind of like a notion around this like the reason Power Hour works so well is the dealers or the counterparty that are these options market makers they need to basically
(04:31) like submit their risk profile to their Clearing House at 3M each day and then also there's a bunch of people who are day trading or are doing you know other random stuff that are going to need to close out their options at the end of the day so there's a bunch of people trying to basically buy or sell options and we can be there to take them to expiration and then by doing that the move like you know the th is just accelerated so it becomes pretty nice it's just a little more of like an intricate execution thing that will end
(05:05) up playing but like this is basically why I said it and it never makes sense what goes on during Power Hour like today the market went down like 30 points and then returned back another 30 points up in the last like half hour of the day basically so I kind of like these trades because it's like there's just zero way you could ever predict what is going on but basically what I would say is yeah we'll trade this at 3 and 330 and then that'll basically uh roll with it does that make sense yeah um I did have a question though um what
(05:40) I where I got thrown off on this one is how do I do like so let's say I'm running this one I'm moving this to a dollar and I'm moving this to um like6 um and I'm going down here and I'm putting my 330 how do I do three and 330 is that time huh go to add entry time oh and then you just type it in a dog and three yep and then you have to take pm and then it it'll just run it twice oh yeah

(00:00) in terms of back testing what I want you to do is there's this thing called the checklist Manifesto is basically a book written by Atul raand it's basically says that 90% of our mistakes even though they're made by extremely intelligent people can be prevented just by people thinking 90% of our mistakes even though they're made by extremely intelligent people can be prevented just by people thinking and the way he does this is through checklist and examples he gives is all airplanes have checklists like
(00:40) every time before they do something they do this checklist and check it and it has drastically reduce the amount of mistakes basically staff infection is the number one source of like death basically in hospitals and they lower that by 80% by just simply instituting a checklist so I'm going to have you go through and test the all ended open trade and kind of run you through the process that I do to trade it so in order to not get screwed up when you start because this happens to everyone when we back test if we're going to do
(01:16) 100 back test with a bunch of different filters in comparison you're eventually going to input the wrong filters and then you'll be like hm that looks weird and then you'll go back and look at it and you'll be like oh holy I completely put in in the wrong parameters so usually a pretty good practice when you're starting out to get better at it for example is you would basically be like okay my data set this is what's called a redo checklist so you read it out loud as you do the steps so in options Omega
(01:48) you would basically be like the data set is 111220 through 101 2024 I'm using a150 put or a175 put and a125 call 4X stop on each leg I'm using leg groups their title put side and call side my portfolio is one lot on $100,000 account my inry slipage is 5 cents my exit slippage is 5 cents per vertical spread 5 cents per dollar premium my exit slippage is 5 cents per there I'm using all days a week $1 commission fees ignoring wide bid ass spreads capping at stoploss National bid best offer only you can see your entry premium 175 entry
(02:27) Sage 110 exit premium 875 it's four times that exit premium 22 cents so you don't have to read that out every time but that's going to be a good practice to where you don't screw up so even though it takes longer day by day it's going to do it and then I basically outlined a bunch of filters here for you to do the back test once you do the back test with those parameters obviously these are filters and you'd add it you know like you're going to put the number of Trades the compounded annual growth
(03:01) rate which will be a percentage the Max draw down which will be a percentage and then the premium capture rate which is a percentage does that all make sense thus far no yeah that makes perfect sense I was reading through that this morning and it made Pretty Good Sense on the trades what is the the trade trades is a number so like let's say you trade for four years you have a thousand trades you know what I'm say yeah so for example if we were to use like a filter um or or this one it says like 15 vix so we kind of know when we put this
(03:33) here even though there's five basically data sets here this could only be 10% of the trades you know what I'm saying so that's kind of a good value to do it and then we'll review this next time we talk and uh if you want you can just do these on SPX dailies because it's going to be quicker for the back test around it'll only take 25 seconds instead of like three minutes it's more that you get in the habit of doing it in the main thing that we do here is like okay we basically we'll go through and we'll do
(04:10) the back test and once we've done the back test we would you know confirm all their parameters are right this will basically be done by you do all the back test you see that all the numbers are kind of similar to one another so obviously you probably met the parameters and definitely every time before you do a new data set you should read this out and like reenter in each one so you make sure it's correct makes sense and once once you've done that and done the data you'll just basically write confirmed in that so you know that
(04:41) you actually did that correct and then I want you to do some critical thinking and we can walk through a few of these ourself right now but for example this one is slippage tolerance so in regards to slippage tolerance we always talk about implied volatility minus realiz volatility minus commission slipage and fees yeah so a huge basically profitability lever of our Edge is based on the slippage so when we're doing this test if it's a $150 as side you know we're probably not going to get 10 cent slippage but this
(05:17) can basically show like if we can make money at 20 cents slippage we can make money at 25 cents 30 cents 35 cents 40 cents we know we have some float and Edge because slippage could basically double we could still not lose money whereas if we were running a trade that looked really good at 20 cent slippage and then it was unprofitable 25 cent slippage we probably wouldn't run run that so that would be kind of the purpose of the trade you know what I'm saying so you would write that in so you're thinking critically like why do
(05:45) we have this in there and then the conclusion is basically after you have the data and you obviously started with the purpose at the beginning you could be like okay our conclusion is that this trade is a good trade because even if we double the amount of slippage that we assume with 25 cents on the back test the trade is still profitable for example so now we're kind of knowing the why behind it and then we go to the next step so we can kind of walk through this one so first thing is what's the vix do
(06:19) you know how to explain that to me the vix is uh volatility correct is that is the is a kind of like a back of the napkin calculation of the volatility of the SPX so the VIX Index by the book is the Vol volatility index of the SPX which is what we trade so you're correct the vix is volatility but basically it uses option pricing from the SPX which is what we trade to determine what that volatility measure is so if the vix is higher is volatility lower or higher when the vix is 30 if it's 30 % is going
(07:00) to be a lot higher than if it's like well if it's like3 it's going to be a lot higher than it is if it's like 05 or something like that correct it's it's on an absolute scale so the higher the number the higher the volatility exactly so showing this with three slots that it's sub 15 15 to 18 18 to 21 and 30 what do you think the purpose of back testing these five ranges would be um just it's going to be dependent on the market so like if the market is let's say the vix in the market right now is
(07:37) 15 like how's this back test going to perform when the vix is at that versus when the vix is at 25 to 30 basically correct we're basically seeing like does this trade need High volatility to work or it's what I like to call an evergreen trade so the reason it's called an evergreen trade is because deciduous trees they lose their leaves in the winter so they don't they don't have leaves all the way around so basically it'd be a deciduous trade if it only worked when the volatility was above 20
(08:09) because that's only half the time whereas it's an evergreen trade because evergreen trees never lose their leaves so in Winter Evergreen trades have leaves in summer evergreen trees have leaves and they're green except for in California where they turn brown and light on fire but for the most part they're they're Evergreen so now that you know that let's say there's two scenarios here and you can basically explain it to me so you do the purpose first you would do your redo checklist
(08:36) at the parameters right and then you would input your data so let's say this is example one so if this was the PCR here what would your conclusion be if these were the results of the back test now do you remember what PCR is uh premium C capture rate and that means what um basically just how much premium we collecting on each trade no it's how much p&l you get per dollar of Premium you s all right per dollar so PCR yeah PCR is p&l per dollar sold of Premium premium is what you get when you open the trade so if you saw
(09:20) this what would your conclusion be about this trade it only works when it's low volatility or it works the best when it's low volatility but as volatility increases it starts working less and less yeah so maybe here you'd be like this trade is better suited for lowall um don't trade when the vix is above 30 yeah you know what I'm saying and then another thing you could do with this too is to like I have all years here because I want a big data set the yeah zero DT data set goes back to 2016
(09:55) but then I also have SPX dailies here because the thing we want to know years is obviously the current environment since SPX trade five days a week is better like the market today is more similar to 2022 and 2023 and is 2026 yeah so if you did this exact same test and the SPX da is a function and options Omega you just click on and it'll populate the data set for you and then all of a sudden what if the data set was like this in dailies then would I conclude what would your conclusion be now it's an evergreen
(10:34) trade exactly and what what was the difference that you learned between these these two trades um is you know maybe the the the 2000 I'm trying to put it into words but with the new market and now that we can trade you know five times a week like this is a more accurate version of what it's actually going to perform like in the market today yeah and the other thing too is like in 2016 the S&P was 2,000 and now it's almost 6,000 so if we're collecting a dollar of Premium that means two really different things
(11:12) you know what I'm saying so the other thing when you come to conclusion is you could be like okay like uh what if I tested uh like less premium in 2016 like would I would I get similar would I get similar results and this ultimately is so this is just a a logic chain that I just put here like we're not GNA filter out days of the week but for example if we had a trade where 100% of the profitability like let's say it was like this 90% zero -10 negative - 255 negative 50 no trades really have this
(11:53) yeah but if this were to happen you know we'd be like okay we don't want to trade this because it's all coming from one day like they going on but this isn't necessarily the purpose of it isn't necessarily for you to just be clicking on it and do it and just write a conclusion this is giving you the ability to start to recognize patterns so if you saw this then maybe you go back to options Omega so let's say you saw something like this and then all of a sudden you look at it so for example
(12:24) with this trade yeah you're like hm okay all the money was made in 2022 yeah so this is how you kind of look at it so the whole point is this back test is supposed to prompt your curiosity to look at certain things in here so we can see okay this doesn't work in 2024 that's kind of concerning you know so then maybe you go in the trade log and you say okay what's been happening in 2024 or you export this and you look on Excel and you're like okay you know where are my losses coming from and why
(13:02) so you can start to look at stuff and more curios to that or you could be like what if I you know changed the parameters to $2 now and this is kind of so this is what I want to prompt with the exercise more than anything else is not just the conclusion it's the pattern of thinking yeah because I basically what I'm trying to do is I've given you a test that I know the results are going to go so I've left breadcrumbs to get you 90% of the way there and like rationally you'll critically think a
(13:38) little bit that you should probably get to the same result as me or next time we talk when you struggle through of it you've come to the main result because by doing this what we're going to do is we're going to create a circumstance where we can see what your constraint is so your constraint may not be your critical thinking yet because you just are  up on back testing so by you copying a back test and not like critically going down this path even though I know where it's going to end so this is like a better way for you to
(14:11) learn we're going to determine where your weak point is quick because like if you sit on here and test and you can't get options of make it to work like we just kind of have a problem there like we're too down the line so like let's get there and like you have more resources now to effectively resolve that or ask questions why that are lower level which basically makes a better use of just time in general for whatever that constraint is or maybe you're good at testing but then when you make your
(14:44) conclusions even though you can input the numbers in the back testing software you don't really understand critically where that step is so then we can address that portion of it so that's kind of I guess the near-term home work uh for you to do and like I said if you want to use SPX daes that's completely fine I'll also give you a hack here so if we go back to back to the presentation here if we test a trade for example this trade is running since 2020 okay it's going to take 75 seconds to
(15:19) run so this is a waste of time if you're sitting in your room by yourself you're effectively getting zero value added and you're just waiting for time to pass MH so the best practice if you want to do these quick is if you duplicate this tab which can be done with basically a hotkey so like once you're on here it's always going to duplicate this test so it's Uber Uber Uber important that we have the correct parameters in here because then we're just going to be multiplying it and not checking it so
(15:51) this is where the redo check with does open trade at 3:00 every day but basically this is still running but while you're doing that you could basically you know get the fix filter here this one was below 15 you can go 15 to 18 so now you're running two tests right now simultaneously you can duplicate it again and you can go 18 to 21 so now we're doing three times of work in the same SI so this is for example you know 200 back test this would take you for  ever if you're actually waiting for it to load like this you know but
(16:28) since you're d duplicating it and doing that we can get more work done in less in less of the time or other thing you can do is like if one of the data sets looks off in the back test that you just recorded you can just sit there and think about what the other one like why is that wrong you know what I'm saying or like you could be doing your conclusion while a back test is running I don't know if that's the best way to do it because you're starting out so maybe you want to just sit there and
(16:59) think um so I'm not really going to justify that for you but no that makes sense you're probably going to get the hang of it within a relatively short amount of time yeah that makes perfect sense I uh I like I like that a lot um how on the duplicate duplication of the link and I just copy and paste that link into a new tab and it's the same is that the exact same thing you're doing like as the test is running I just yeah you can paste the link but if you right click and say duplicate it just automatically doesn't same New link
(17:30) so like you would have to click plus copy and paste in the link it would load and do it so it take longer makes sense that's dope yeah that's I think that'll allow me to do it a lot more efficiently but I love this this this HS him up because like that I thought that XL Spreadsheet was really cool but to be able to see that I think it's GNA like help me learn this at a much higher rate I really do yeah and this process is like a more dumb down level than the navigation uh presentation that I gave
(18:04) so if you go to the YouTube and watch how they create a systemic options portfolio if you rewatch that that's effectively the task I'm asking you to do so it probably be worth rewatching that or like if you're in the car driving to work you could listen to it and that would kind of give you like an insight into what that is um but this is ultimately what it comes down to is like back testing is kind of a volume game like you only get good at it from taking a bunch of from doing an insane amount of back test and
(18:38) then messing up the just key underlying factor is that you're going to mess up it's just how many times are you going to make that mistake before you um you know learn it and actually make it happen so this is also why it's good that you'll just be basically getting paid more off of a p&l instead of so you're going to be pissed when you an doing this and then you just realize that all of your back tests are wrong yeah you know what I'm saying so it's like th that is a in it sucks no like
(19:15) but but that's why I've given you the redo checklist because like if you read and do that you shouldn't really make mistakes but there's obviously a balance between spending 45 seconds to read what you're doing and then actually having the back test doing it but you'll start to like catch these patterns quicker no I mean I think this is going to make a lot better content too because like I think it's GNA bring the emotion into it rather than me just looking at a trade yeah I want you I want you to get pissed
(19:42) and then the other thing you'll realize too is it's mentally kind of straining and a lot of people based on what they do in their day-to-day jobs unless they're an engineer that like works on CAD it's a type of me strain you're like out of shape of or you're not used to so if you do it for 45 minutes and that's kind of like your end you'll you'll notice you'll just start up a lot and then basically like your critical thinking's done so you'll get in better shape as you get along the line of doing
(20:16) that so like for example I can do an entire Market day now of just this with like no sounds and I don't really drop off with my ability to think it took like four years get that much endurance when I first started I could only do it for like 90 minutes or something yeah when we started this back in July I remember like after IID listen to like navigation or I would read those um those uh the the letters like the the trading letters that he had me read and all that stuff like by about 45 minutes to an hour in I was like dude it takes a
(20:53) while it's a different side of your brain it's like creativity and critical thinking um yeah so it takes a minute yeah the intake is what I realized like the intake and processing of the information that you're giving because you're right it's so mathematical and there's so there's just so many filter just to even understand the back testing and the filters was insane so yeah I'm excited though I think it's going to be really interesting to see how this grows and see where this is in two to three
(21:23) months

Transcript:
(00:00) okay Mark Anderson here construction worker turn zero DT hedge fund manager Connor part-time Trader do away his 30 grand account um we wanted to go over kind of Connor's homework for last time so Connor if you just want to share your screen and we'll kind of walk through what you found and we'll go over basically like the takeaways of what you found alongside everything else okay so let's start out with the final product and then kind of tell tell me initially what pequ your interest about this and then we will venture into
(00:38) the spreadsheeting the individual stages of how you got here perfect so what initially pequ my interest about this is um when I was looking at the prices of the the put in the call um I started I started seeing that when I was around you know the the two Mark or the the on the two mark on the um on the foot side and on the 150 175 mark on the uh call side I saw that that's where I was getting the best um that's where I was getting the best kers that's where I was getting the best Pino and the bars and everything that we were
(01:18) looking for and so knowing that knowing that what we ran in the past I know we ran a two in the past and that's something that we were normally ripping I just wanted to test out like all right we usually ran a two and a one and we both knew going into that that that was probably going to be a good a good trade and we uh the back test was reflecting that but the back test popped up a really good um we'll go into this but it popped up really good results for 2.
(01:50) 25 and really good results for 1.75 on the fal side so I was like what's this happen if I just um what happens if I just you know put these in there let's just see if that trade works and I put that trade initially in there and um it did work on the p&l and all this was showing but it did not perform in 2024 so I was like all right how do I make this trade perform in 2024 and I remember you told me you got to throw some uh volatility in there um some stopping on the volatility for that to happen so what I did is I put um I put
(02:26) uh let me see what did I end up putting on the volatility I put the max fall at um max fall at 0.25 and that evened it out basically I I was still seeing it actually increased the p&l by like uh 25,000 and it actually made it perform in 2024 too so that's really my summary of what I found through the back test um and yeah we want to hop in the back um let's walk through step by step I actually made some some adjustments with this too because I noticed that even in long vola I mean in high volatility or I mean in
(03:03) low volatility we seems like we can collect more premium at the beginning so this is nice that you know we're only using five grand of buying power so we collect another 50 bucks that's basic another one you know 1% we potentially do with it so let's walk through the steps of kind of what you saw with your testing that went through that so we'll go through basically like what was your takeaway or the purpose that you thought of it and then what was your conclusion so on this one it was excess slippage I
(03:29) I wasn't able to get to all of them but I did run a couple of them just the DraStic at 0.1 and the and the DraStic at 05 and what I saw on here as the exit slippage at 0.25 and at 0.1 there wasn't a big difference but there was enough there's a big enough difference that I just decided to go with the 0.
(03:50) 25 because I saw a bigger premium capture capture rate and I just we know that results to more money so I just went with the 0.25 um this is good here because it's like you're obviously time constrained you're a regular person that works and has a kid so it's like you still did the work you know but you did it what was most efficient um the other thing too that is good about this is what do you think this tells us by at 10 cents exit slippage 25 cents exit slippage and 50 cents exit slippage we still have quite
(04:23) a bit of edge in terms of Premium capture so remember if we go back to our profit is implied volatility minus realized volatility commission slippage and fees what was the takeaway that you got from this and what do you think the purpose of testing this like this was yeah perfect um I would say that it it still performs well at the beginning uh I mean when volatility is relatively I mean when the exit slippage is relatively at uh one and it it continues to perform um pretty well as the slippage continues to rise as well but
(04:58) then it I mean it performs well throughout the whole thing like even if you look at 05 like that's not a bad trade at all and that's a huge amount of slippage so would you say like what do you think this means like what does this trade have a lot of that is shown by it still profits when you have twice the expected slippage um it just I mean it's just a it's I I want to say it's almost like an evergreen trade yeah that so the thing I wanted to show with this is we have our back test and then we have
(05:35) to match our back test so the problems with that and this is kind of what we're going through is that the more data we filter out and the more filters we have and the less trades we take the more likely we're going to deviate from the expected result the second process to that is once we find a trade that's profitable there's our ability to execute on the trade which yeah in regards to putting on the trade we can automate it that's very easy but in terms of exiting the train we kind of just have to take whatever price the
(06:03) market is because we're cutting our risk so this basically shows you know if our execution gets poorer for no fault of our own because the exit slippage we just have to pay what we have to pay it looks like we're still going to make money or what this kind of shows is I'll talk about EV or what I call expected value so basically EV or expected value is a process of the PCR so even with 50 Cent slippage we're making we have a 21% premium capture or a 21 cent expected value on every dollar we sell does that
(06:34) make sense yeah that makes perfect sense okay now this one I kind of anticipated you to Now get stuck and kind of like catch on a revelation so scroll down a little more to where it shows the vix yeah this one was confusing to be completely honest with you um can you explain to me like what was confusing and then what you know about the vix and the ranges of the vix yeah yeah so um I'll start off with just explaining why it's confusing because you see the exit slippage it's almost like all right this
(07:08) could be an evergreen trade you know it could be something that like it's performing even if our slippage is at 50 which like you said is a drastic slippage but then I I come in here and I was hoping that that would confirm that like of course that the the vixs and again what I what I think the vix is it's just it's just a it's just a volatility so you know how volatile is the market and if this is sub 15 it's you know I know that that is not a very volatile Market all the way up to above
(07:36) 30 I know it's a very volatile market so when I'm looking at the premium capture on these and just the results from it um I'm seeing that you know it performs all right it performs pretty decent um it uh actually it's not performing I mean it performs all right at the beginning um under 15 and then it performs pretty similar and then you for a second here so I understand you're learning and I gave you a task to execute on but a lesson that I kind of like is that like Warren Buffett and Charlie merer talk
(08:11) about they'll look at an investment and then they just say too hard like it's not obvious so you clearly made an assumption about the first slippage thing that it looked ever green and not much affected it and now confused yeah so instead of trying even though theise is to write a conclusion it's perfectly fine to be like too hard coming back to and then we may be able to kind of uncover more of this treasure map as we go through the steps so we can kind of write this one too hard and then we could try to theorize what this means
(08:48) makesense further we get into the back test yeah so why don't you scroll down and then show me one that you feel confident you realize some type of trend or conclusion in yeah so um let me see this one I realized a trended conclusion that it performs um and explain to me what this filter is and what you think it means first so we kind of have the emotional and thought behind what's it mean rather than just like we're putting a filter on a filter so let's try to understand what the process of this is so we're trying
(09:25) to what we're doing is we're trying to break this into individualized steps and once we've understand that concept we can then kind of contextualize it and it may help us get insights and other things and this will take as long as it takes if you don't know like feel free to ask questions or anything no 100% And um again like you said for the audience I want to be able to explain this well so you can correct me if I'm wrong but this is the vix open up and the vix open down filter correct um so this is if it
(09:55) changes by 0 2% up or if it changes by you know 02 % down on this one that's correct it's up or down in regards to what what numbers what time frames does that up at the market open of the market of the B correct yep so and that's comparative to what it's the market open comparative to at the price right of is that or am I wrong on that so it's the market open price comparative to the market close price so the Market opens at what time uh 9:30 and the market closes at what time that's not as
(10:34) important but is it 4 correct so this is basically comparing yesterday's 400m close of the vix to today's or the day you traded open of the vix at 932 so if it was higher than it was yesterday what is that telling us about volatility risk premium in the market um are you talking about this one are you just talking if higher if it was higher than it was yesterday then it raised raised and to kind of give you more context about this in general the highest amount of volatility risk premium is present overnight and this is
(11:14) because the Market's not open so you can't transact so obviously people would potentially want to limit what that risk is for themselves so if the volatility didn't come out overnight and we're trading zero days to expiration options we know that that volatility has to finish or expire by the end of day so knowing that what do you think or you could theorize that the vix opening up kind of means in context to that um so can you repeat that just one more time so I can get a good in in general
(11:50) volatility is a proxy do you know what proxy means kind of like a determinant or predictor of so volatility is a proxy of r risk so in general there's a lot of volatility risk premium that is present overnight between 4M and 9:30 and that is because the Market's not open so you can't transact so if the market were to move 1% you can't get out so in general yeah so in general the volatility usually kind of comes out overnight unless it was like a volatile close or something and then it'll open
(12:27) potentially down but we also know that since we're trading zero day options at the end of day volatility is now gone because the move occurred and everything that is known that is known so is that mean that there's no risk overnight or is there there's more risk overnight that's why volatility is generally it could decrease into the open you know what I'm saying because you can't so if we're in a Marketplace like zero DT where we can actively transact with our stop loss even though
(12:56) we have the same amount of risk we have the ability to manage our risk very easily whereas in the middle of the night because we don't have the ability to transact even though we're holding this amount of risk there's more there's more likely risk so sense knowing that why do you think this is a good proxy for you got to see how the trade is going to perform right off the open because when the volatility is at the highest I know that like I might be contradicting Myself by speaking this but I think you just need to know how is
(13:28) this trade going to perform at the open when I know the volatility lowers but would the volatility relatively be the highest at the open because of the overnight volatility yeah so the volatility has to come out eventually so if it starts at 4M you know Thursday it has to come out by 4M Friday if it's a onezero data expiration option so if it didn't come out over those 9 hours there's probably more volatility that is going to come out during the six hours we're trading it now which looking at this what is you
(14:04) know looking at this statistic what do this trend kind of tell us that's where I was going to get to so this is the one that I was like all right this makes sense to me it shows me that this trade on both sides it performs very well at the beginning um at the open meaning and I mean it still performs pretty decent throughout the day on this one it doesn't it doesn't perform good um if it's we lose money it doesn't work yeah yeah it doesn't work but on this one it performs pretty pretty good at the
(14:41) open yeah and you can see that yeah it's consistent so like the kind of concept here is there's like Randomness which is just a bunch of dots yeah like imagine we're on a piece of paper and there's just a bunch of dots and they're like okay how are we going to trade this you are you're just like going up and down and connecting the dots that was basically that test about like days of the week or like random stuff it made no sense you know what I'm saying then there's basically like curve
(15:09) fitting that would be like on Fridays is the best day and then on Fridays when the vix opens up that's also good and then you know when it's not the last Friday of the month it's really really good so that would be like curvefitting because you're drawing causation between things that probably aren't correlated and then there's something like this where there's like dots but they seem to kind of be going in the same Trend so instead of drawing the dots you just draw a straight line through all the
(15:38) dots and you say hey I think we're on to something here so it's good that you picked up on that and then you instituted in the filter so you actioned upon it and then you made a good trade but now I want to Circle back to where you were like thinking kind of hard so if we scrolled back up to one of the the metrics that didn't so let's look at uh like the days of the week here we go y random what so so this looks random but now let's theorize maybe why it's so good on Wednesday you know what I'm saying or is the ball
(16:18) coming out by Wednesday yeah or if we were going to you know let's try to go back to algebra and algebra we have like a plus b like quot X is equal to our potential answer so we know one of the variables in our trade which is when the vix is up that probably leads to profit for us and S and slippage doesn't really matter so if we wanted to kind of like invert this how do you think we could basically like bust the thought process that Thursdays or Fridays don't work well what would we test how would we
(16:55) test that to try to solve for like an individual variable so if the vix is up and we perform well when the vix is up but we don't perform well in this data set on Thursdays and Fridays how would we potentially prove that it actually works to trade on Thursdays and Fridays um would we have to per would we have to uh and I might be overthinking this one would we have to put it into the back test as the assuming the bigs might be down on Thursdays and Fridays and see how it performs or exact exctly so that so that means if
(17:31) we now tested if the vix so maybe what this is showing us here is that the vix just often happens to open down on Thursdays and Fridays rather than Thursdays or Fridays don't work and we could also say hey this probably makes sense because if Wednesday works really good the vix probably often opens up on Wednesdays so since the volatility goes way down on Wednesday or way up on Wednesday it could be down on Thursday and Friday Friday so to solve for that individual variable to see if we're doing the correct hypothesis rather than
(18:05) just throwing random stuff against the wall we can basically be like if we only tested we're always gonna TR uh trade all five days of the week but we would test on Thursdays and Fridays when the vix opens up what's our result when the vix opens down what's our result and if those show that it loses money when the vix is down and it still has like a 20 to 25% premium CCH the vix up all of a sudden we know it's not the days of the week it's about the vix and it just so happens that those days of the week the
(18:36) vix normally opens down which doesn't really that's click now that like think about it as like basic algebra you know what I'm saying yeah so it's all tied back to the Vic so it's not really it's just the I mean for I don't I don't know if that's necessarily for every trade just for this trade in particular it's tying back like that X equation it's tying back to the B in this correct and what we're trying to do is we're never trying to filter out occurrences or curve but by doing all
(19:08) these particular parameters we're trying to basically test our hypothesis that no matter what other parameters we work in the one thing that actually makes a difference is this fix going up or down makes perfect sense I think that was good for today um this trade is good to run we will start posting the descriptions and getting rolling it's currently active trading in trade Stewart for like a week now um so we basically have this going and then we'll get another probably three trades but we'll slowly work on it and then
(19:45) we'll basically get to a point where you've got a full portfolio and then we can share how much money you're making week to week perfect

Transcript:
(00:00) made sense to me and I'd rather go with a theory that made sense cuz I can fully explain it than something that I couldn't really explain does that make sense um so all so what I got from this is because it's a fil Delta and a 15 Del and they're matched I I I've learned that that would usually lead to believe that we're going delta neutral on this one and because it's a trade at 350 at at the end of the day um and that there's no vix filter on here um and because it's delta neutral I
(00:38) realize that since it says usually with delta neutral trade you're not focusing on the price change you're focused on the volatility change and I figured that since it's at 350 the graph when you look at the SPs SPX graph there's not a lot of change down there but there is enough change at the end of the day for us to still make money off of the volatility but we're not like going to be going crazy with it um it's kind of going to be settling down but there's still enough movement to make money so I
(01:06) figure that that's kind of was the purpose of this trade okay um that's pretty spoton now kind of looking at this trade was there anything in particular that concerned you with the performance of this trade I was really thinking about the theory of it it wasn't say that it was a a pretty good performing trade when it when it depends on like what we're trying to do if like it seemed like when you're I was looking at this portfolio you're just looking at a base hit portfolio so like it was a
(01:43) pretty good trade um because it has a very low draw down um and it does make us money and it does uh make us premium it does concern me a little bit about um you know it performed really well in 2022 and 2023 it's performing and it has a little bit more of a draw down in 2024 that concerns me a little bit um but let me see oh and the winning percentage I didn't see that the winning percentage only being 66% that concerns me a little bit as well I'd like to see that closer to like 70 or 80 especially with a Bas
(02:19) hit trade because you're not making much off of it and you're like look at the loser like the max winner versus the max loser so like I want to win more to balance out my losses as well so huh okay yeah so let's kind of unpack all the steps in this and then also when we're analyzing a back test we'll kind of go line by line here so uh if you look kind of like at this first thing we have our dates between May 16th of 2022 and then obviously present day the reason this is the case is because May
(03:04) 16th is when SPX daily began to occur on a five-day week basis so before that the expirations were only Monday Wednesday and Friday with this trade being a two Daya expiration that's placed on Monday that would be a Wednesday expiration and then a basically um Friday expiration as well so in regards to that uh this could have traded a long time ago but um we're more concerned with the recency in regards to the um calendars because uh with that the SPX price is kind of a little significantly different in the
(03:53) past and it may have not been as liquid before the SPX dailies um so I would say we're going to lean towards the count ERS on this uh as SPX expiration my thing with that also is since it's profitable in all three years um that's good so we can't expect I would say this trade is not necessarily an outlier but that 2022 was an outlier of understated volatility and the other thing to think about this is when volatility is higher even if it's still 10% overstated there's more dollars in that position
(04:31) each and every day so we're going to drag more from just getting in and out um in that period of time basically what we're trying to do here is since it opens at 3:50 and then we close it in the morning on um basically Wednesday I saw that too mainly trying to capture the overnight premium which is which is Rich and I know this technically isn't zero DTE but the thing I want people to think about when we're going through this is the benefit of this in a zero GT portfolio is that this position does come off on
(05:08) Wednesday so we can reuse that buying power again on Wednesday so we basically get two trades in a week for the same buying power the other yeah thing with this trade is since it's risk defined and you see there's no stoploss here is that during our credit trades if the market kind of Bing bangs up and down yeah we get stopped out we get stopped out on the put side and the call side a really up and down thing whereas all the noise over 48 hours for this type of trade is basically irrelevant it just matters if it crosses that perfect it's
(05:42) called The Profit tent so if you were to think of like our wris reward it kind of looks like I'll draw this out I think this is how a double calendar works but so basically we kind of have a like you could see this is like the perfect 40% Target and then our profit kind of like tails off in regards to there you can go back to the back test so visually without that stop if we just cross through it's called a tent that profit tent where like a day into the trade it's decayed and then we like pin the exact same strike from entrance that
(06:18) is basically like perfect um for this type of trade so it's a lot different mindset of a traditional ZT trade but you could kind of see the benefit in regards to um yeah the diversification that this is going to provide to us the other thing I want to show you to is if you click trade log yeah so you can see here that it says DB DB DB you see that prium so that means it's a debit trade so this is why we can basically not use a stoploss because with that debit um our risk is somewhat defined yeah or what
(07:00) that's going to be see the lines that go through that one test up there too so what that those lines mean is that there is a wide bit ass spread so if you scroll all the way to the top you can see here that it says um we're excluding wide bit ask in our back test so that kind of shows what that is the other thing too when we do this back test is let's continue to scoll so like you see this first trade it says profit Target you can see that our open price was 55.
(07:34) 93 and then when we hit our profit take it was 5611 so that kind of shows like over the course of basically two days the SPX only moved 20 points which yielded a profit and then you can see the one below that on the Monday we entered at 5335 and it went up close to 100 points but we basically broke even on that so this is just a better way to kind of understand what that looks like and then going back to your percent win rate if you scroll up here we're not really concerned with that rate because there's something that's basically referred to
(08:11) as expected value and expected value would be our average win times the percentage minus our you know average loss times the percent we lose so you can see here our average win is $230 and our average loser is 161 wow our break even win 40% with that that kind make sense um yeah and then the other things under miscellaneous y uh so we have 20 cents entry slippage and 20 cents exit slippage um again if we look at kind of those average premiums we're around $1,500 so you know we'll call roughly 2% of that in and out since it's not going
(08:56) to be a stop loss really it's just exiting through the market 20 sense is pretty accurate um then we also have cap profits and basically what that means is if we were to hit our profit take instead of just taking yeah and like if the market were to Gap up 50 cents instantaneously you know that's what would happen in real life but what capping profits does is just whatever our profit take it'll just subtract 20 cents from it when it hits an options Omega so on a day-to-day basis that may not be the most accurate reflection
(09:25) because obviously the market jumps in price a little bit however about for when you set that profit take like hey we hit that 40% profit take we're going to take our profit and run before this dips down right yeah so basically you know we back tested let's say 10% 20% 30% and the win rate versus the average loss and average loser this looked most attractive basically so that's kind of why we took and you can also see here again this is kind of contextualized in the back test so there's more numbers so like scroll
(10:05) down and then skip to like the second page so scroll all the way down and then click the right arrow so we can see here that um you know our exited so if you look at this right hand column says reason close exited specific time exited you can just scroll down you see all those so basically this is almo
(10:30) st always going to 10: a.m. on Wednesday however uh we just have the 40% profit take because if it was really good that's kind of like the attractiveness of where we would take it so the 40% profit take if we hit it it's probably going to be Wednesday morning so this is more of a whole till expiration trade but basically if we get some really nice price action that it gets between that 10 we'll basically take it the main thing you want is it's just going to Decay and then if you go back up I know you identified this trade
(10:59) is a delta neutral trade all right so the other thing to understand with this is the what's called a short when I was looking Stu up remember when we were looking at that chart thing basically yeah so the way to think about this is all the shorter the duration option the faster the option decays so a two option is going to Decay faster than a four day option does that make sense so as we and then each pending hour as that short option gets closer and closer to zero DT and it get closer and closer to one hour expiration it
(11:38) exponentially speeds up it's Decay so if this trade like you can see on that first Monday January 29th 2024 this trade basically the price only moved you know 30 points over three days so basically from no movement since we volatility this thing expired and it decayed 187 bucks so because the market didn't do anything oh that's why the the the delta neutral is good position because if the market doesn't do anything you're good and you're making money off of it yeah so the way to think of this
(12:23) trade and it's like for fun in games you can creatively name it so if you want to click the little Notepad and then we can call this Monday 24 DC and then put like quotations and say no news adds like Contex for me a little bit yeah and that's yeah no news is good news um yeah and that's essentially what we're trying to do this is like the boring trait you know what I'm saying it's like we don't really Harbor a lot of risk it doesn't really matter if it gaps up violently lower or higher we
(13:02) just kind of want that and then the thing I want you to understand is putting a little more context Behind These trades so if you want to click that download thing right here um I think so is is this export to CDs you may not on this computer yeah click it I think I have like the the basic one that allow me to at least view it oh here it goes I was trying to that looks like worse okay so now the next thing I want you to do is go to scroll right a little bit okay so on W click W click the top W and go to data up the top do this to
(13:55) edit fre well I think let me to edit basically if you kind of uh uh if you click in X and go equal click the equal uh if you go to yeah just click there and then go equal see if that populates anything equal Min okay now double click men and now start with the second row and then pull it all the way down to the bottom and now now hold it and pull it all the way down oops try that again equals Min uh just click back on the formula yeah there you go now scroll it all just so so actually you could just type it in so just goes equal equal Min I'll equal
(14:57) Min and then go parenthe es or double hash dot uh go W2 yep and then uh the key next to the L and then W Okay now click enter you want me just drag it down um but basically yeah just drag it down be the same thing we don't I think you put in a parentheses instead of the other one or a yeah drag it down yeah just drag it all the way down to the bottom where there's no more letters Okay now click enter okay so that's our biggest loss is minus 50.
(15:50) 2 4 so now scroll down and look for a five um see if okay there it is okay that date what's the date 2 21523 uh 25 okay now go back to the back test yeah so I I want to see what caused this 215 2023 was a date so now skip over so that's February 15 so you can use at the bottom right to get over to that okay there it is is feu February 13th okay so let's see what happened here so this is a weird trade and this why double calendars are weird so the price was 4135 and then the price ended at 4111 so it didn't move yet we got destroyed on
(16:45) this trade yeah so no it doesn't make sense because we're short data you know what I'm saying um so what I think happen because the whole point yeah you're right it doesn't make sense because the whole point of the trade is for it to not move 20 okay so there so there was a Fed meeting yeah so this wasn't during a Fed meeting and this is double calendars don't really make sense in a shorter duration but basically there was probably some event that smashed volatility that was tied to
(17:23) the Friday expiration so like maybe they said something on Wednesday morning like there was a date announcement and then it just completely smashed the volatility that was on Friday so instead of the front decaying faster than the back it didn't happen so the volatility like stayed elevated on Friday and then it didn't on Wednesday so there was probably a news event but this is what I like to say is like we're understanding this back test it normally performs that's when we get screwed on this trade but it's
(17:56) performing you know how it just normally performs if itn't move yeah exactly yeah if the market didn't move we should have made money but there's probably event here now uh like if it went down 400 points and yeah I would anticipate losing go back to the spreadsheet and then uh go inter Max so we can see the best winning train in what Happ Max Max you'll have to double click it and then do the same thing freaking there we go 47 so so what was 47 so 42 actually scroll up
(19:03) okay perfect so if you look at 42 yeah the market moved 12 points so that makes more sense because it looks says movement you see that um and then like another yeah Gap doesn't matter but that kind of makes more sense so the market didn't mov be made money you know what I'm saying yeah so this I mean we know this is going to work because it's back testing but it's a new context to why it's working so if we go back to the movement now let's try and find uh scroll up and then go enter Max and then
(19:38) use the movement column which is V yeah it's starting to make sense to me too because when you look at the the movement when it moves a lot I mean when it has a lot that's where the profit is yeah we're screwed yeah um because volatility was not understated and we're technically short volatility so when we're short volatility we're short Vega but we're mostly short Theta and on the other side of theta is gamma which is the change in directional exposure per dollar of SPX change so they're like to thing okay so
(20:16) the largest movement was 74 there is so look at something like that see if you can find 74 there it is okay so we made we made money on this that's kind of but this just gives a little more context that smashed the volatility it went up you know what I'm saying so this is just a way to understand it and I like to analyze the data with within the spreadsheet a little more um and then we'll eventually use this once we have the actual data of a real trade to basically compare um actual trading that came out
(20:54) of our automation software to these results so we'll come back to this data but we'll just check on a yearly basis I mean on a yeah this makes sense though because like when it doesn't move a lot it's still making good money and that's the whole point of the trade like when it's like barely moving it's making really good money too yeah and also that movement reflects kind of the movement from open to close so it could have been a little different that we these hit a good these three
(21:23) makes sense right this one it didn't move much it had made us 47 and then when it moved a lot it didn't make us that much you know um that's those when it start making a little more sense but all right for Tom sake yeah and then another thing too so go to this back test again and go create new back test oh all right okay now so use vix and then uh no actually exit that oh I this one now go up to the top and use vix go up to the top use VI um now go Max fix of 15 so remember right now our win rate is
(22:11) 66% and our capture I believe is like 6% so now click run so this is basically testing our theory that just the higher volatility because we have less drag getting in and out it helps us so this is 7% so our theory was not right that the high volatility is what helped us so I actually like this basically irregardless of volatility environment irregardless of if the vix goes up or down and irregardless of year whether the volatility is 30 or 12 it works and it's it's not really changed so this is a big vote of confidence that this is
(22:49) what we refer to as an evergreen trade um basically trees that are evergreen um don't lose their leaves so basically in winter when stuff's bad and scary I love that TR something because I like I like the yeah yeah this is the new good news Evergreen but this is kind of what we want is these Evergreen trades yeah like this is boring I know you're making a hundred bucks a week basically and basically what this will what this will look like is the first week of the month you'll win 250 second week of the
(23:34) month you'll lose 160 see that's what I saying love about this trade because if you look at the if you look at these we're capturing all of our losses and then some you know what I mean like this is 400 but we made we won 700 so we got a three roughly a $200 profit off of this one so [Music] yeah and if if you go back to the summary yeah quick summary yeah um you can kind of see like what this trade does so basically makes perfect sense I love it and it just just to like take a shot at this whole portfolio we're going to dive in it step
(24:15) by step but like um I really think this portfolio was designed just to be like a solid balanced trading portfolio because a lot of them are like pretty like the next one is like really far out of um you're like you have a 5% chance of being in the money so it's like you're kind of just playing a safe bet but you're also still making money off of that safe bet so and the other thing too if you click on the trade log is this on average uses about two grand of buying power so we're only using 4% of our account value and we're
(24:55) basically doubling our money cuz it averages almost 8% return so this is a really Capital efficient trade 100% very attractive cuz we just made in two years we made you know 10 grand off of this and exactly only on two grand a yeah and we and that option buying power is only used until Wednesday so we could basically use a trade that goes from Wednesday to Monday and we could you know use that buying power twice I was going to ask you so on this one talking about using this Monday basically would we just copy and paste this trade and do
(25:36) new back test and just put it in for um every Wednesday as well so it just is doing the same thing uh I think there may be a Wednesday one there but let's like this is good we're going to run it and the thing kind of here too is we also have required to prices for profit take so basically what that means is for two consecutive minutes it needs to hit our profit take so it'll ensure us that if the market just were to make like one quick blip we could potentially not get filled but like if this get filled we're
(26:11) definitely um going to get filled so like we have our first trade we did our research we have an understanding of this and basically now we're going to stick with this for six months and see how it goes and then we'll start tracking it every other week and we'll be like hey this is in line with what we're expecting one thing I will say on this is you can see that like on that first Monday trade it took a 5540 and a 5640 um those will vary slightly because what will happen is option Omega just
(26:41) enters the trade right at the top of the minute whereas if the computer goes enter the trade at the top of minute let's say within two seconds the SPX went up two points or something we could now take the 5545 or something like that and we may collect $15 we may pay $15 in premium instead of $18 in premium so in the short term we'll get a higher low in order just average out over time the main thing we're concerned with is like yeah if this trade won in the back test it won in real life we're not really
(27:12) concerned with does it have the same strikes and does it have the same debit amount basically so that's more of a Nuance once we go into it we don't necessarily expect to collect the same premium on these in real time but we also um we do expect it to win awesome that's just kind of how it's gonna work let's go to your other trade so we can get this second one done let me see this one yeah so this one I feel like this one pretty self-explanatory on this one um on just like it's a very low Delta so
(27:44) we're saying it's a very low percent chance it's going to be in the money so basically I learned that that is meaning that we're thinking it's not going to strike down really hard you know um yeah yeah we need a massive crash uh like if you scroll down and you look at 2024 uh this thing was clearly doing well until people were calling it vix Zilla which was you know the massive Japanese thing um oh D I've actually never thought it's kind of it's kind of funny it's Japanese and it's called vix
(28:22) because the yeah let let's let's name this one we'll go uh vix Zilla yeah or let's call it pennies in front of vix Zilla Steamroller like let's call it that um but basically some some shit's got to go really wrong for us to lose on this uh and you know the main thing with this is that we just don't get too big and too greedy because you can see in 2024 before vix Zilla or if you go to trade log yeah so this thing scroll down routinely wins you know 20 row oh my gosh yeah it hasn't
(29:10) lost this thing won't lose what to start at August and it only lost the first time it lost was February yeah yeah so this is a pretty set it in for good to trade and you know for people online if they don't want to use a bot this obviously is not very labor intensive um to put on the things we need to note on this is you can see Max loser 894 um so basically the kind of funny thing about this trade is we're selling an option so we believe volatility is understated but then we're buying an option that's relatively expensive so if
(29:52) you look at Friday February 2 we sold a $2.35 option and we bought a $150 option so by this being a tight spread where we've essentially baked in our hedge or Black Swan type protection basically um so that's just kind of a a thing to note with it but no I think you kind of hit the nail on the head on that just saying like it's a very protective trade because you're really um you're playing with the seven DTE as well so you're playing with the the time Decay um so when it gets farther closer to the 70t
(30:27) like it's going to we're going to be able to capitalize off of that time Decay as well and um um yeah I don't know that so um yeah so I I looked into that and I really just looked at this trade as just like a really solid trade like you said I I kind of figured I didn't look at the trade blog but I figured it was winning a lot because it was just like you really are just kind of that you're basically saying the market ain't is not going to just drop like crazy you know and um so by playing out
(31:07) of the money so far um I feel like it was just a safe trade because you're not like making a too big of a prediction that it's going to strike up or it's going to strike down and you're kind of protecting yourself on that so that's where I really was the big thought process behind this trade yeah yep and it's a very good diversifier because it's a s day duration um and then also you can see here's uh I mean this is on a million dollar account so if you want to click I wanted to scale it and see what it would
(31:40) look like on and then change this to a $50,000 account like your account let's do a one lot a one lot uh scroll down see how it says Max contracts per trade change it to one and then go to margin allocation per range and change it to 100 that's just so we know it'll always trade one and then run it um so this is just habits we don't want to run a million dollar account on it because we could look at this and be like Oh Our worst stra down we could take his only a third of a percent so to realistically feel what this feels like
(32:21) we're going to 50 Grand account like what the profit take really look like too all that and um and then do you see that ratio do you remember I can't remember what that means but I know we want to be uh we want to be above one one or above right yeah yep so the easy way to remember m is if you look at that and you divide it by the Max draw down which is right next to it that's how you get it so if you save this back test save this back test yep and then you can just uh yep just replace it so just now click
(33:04) save um and then the other other thing too is when you post this video click the link and post those in the description so other people can see um now click on summary so let's cover this m ratio more so if we scroll down now go to 2018 and hover or go to let's go to 2021 hover over the green so we had a 4.
(33:30) 69% turn and then hover over the red our Max draw down was 99% the 4.69 that is the kager right or return uh technically that's just the return because kager's compounded annual growth rate this would just so you know you just divide these two so that would almost be you know a four point that would almost be close to a one more as well because they're pretty no we would actually be is it so you had a 4.
(34:09) 6% return that would be like four more wouldn't it yeah yeah that is 4.69 yeah so that that's a banger of a year you know what I'm saying um and this is why this is a dangerous trade CU people will get greedy because you could win 20 a row and you like I want to sell a 10 lot and that would be like your whole account um so the main thing with this is you need to understand that like you're gonna get hit and you have no idea like we didn't know that the Japanese Central Bank was going to raise their interest rates randomly after we won 20 in a row that's
(34:46) right here yeah that makes sense so so this is just kind of a thing yeah it was a big drop um but again that long leg that we bought helped us out a lot this is kind of another example where people get greedy so if you click on new back test and then click the X underneath the buy put and then scroll down and click ignore margin requirements and then add a zero to the okay but you can see then click run okay so you can yeah so you can see that we made 15 grand on this trade but what happened was we bought the protection so we're basically spending
(35:34) we're we're selling volatility premium which we think is Rich which is the red put and then we're buying the protection so we're actually buying a lot of what we think is expensive um which is kind of contradictory and we we lost you know 15,000 yeah so he only made 15 grand and then if you were to take away that long option that basically protects us if something were to go wrong you'll see that we made a lot more money yeah but we had a lot more volatility so you see here now we made 61 Grand but our Mar
(36:12) went down because this bad this is an example where it pays more oh yeah yeah to to buy protection you know what I'm saying so and this is the whole concept is you can see here the capture rates lower we make mess less money but by not having negative compounding our risk adjusted return is actually better and this is the concept that I find kind of nuts about this and the way I would describe it is it's like imagine you were selling this but it was a car insurance policy so in this instance when we sell the
(36:51) five Delta fo and we buy the 150 below it like you are selling the car insurance yeah you are selling the car insurance as the car insurance company with the five Delta put but you're also your customer is also making a claim on the car insurance $50 lower and you as the car insurance company made money and the person that bought the car insurance made money also so this is kind of a crazy thought it's like you actually ended up better off and both parties won the party selling the insurance one and the counterparty
(37:30) buying the insurance one which is kind of a wild concept it's not supposed to be how you do it but this is where like people will say oh my God there's no free lunch options are efficient this is an example that options are efficient but somehow both of us can make money and the reason this happened is because the person buying the car insurance is not trying to make money they're just trying to offset that massive loss that they had that they'd have if they get in a car accident and the person selling
(37:57) the car insurance is trying to make money on selling the car insurance but if one one car insurance person gets in a car accident out of every 70 it they still make money so kind of a wild concept but this is how everyone makes money and the market maker that sold this to you and connected the buyer to the seller of the car insurance that's basically the entry slippage and the exit slip it also made money so yeah everyone can make money in this this is like the best welfare system on Earth the Wall Street market makers made money
(38:30) the car insurance company you made money and some hedger a mutual fund on this trade because I thought when we I forgot that when even when we just run back to just running premium captures um and we're doing premium trades like when you sell a put and you buy a put that buying a put it's capping your buying power but it's also protecting you and I forgot about that one yeah awesome freaking fast yeah and the other thing you notice here too is look at the win rate that 94.6% rate corresponds to what the
(39:06) chance of this option is um on this one we're winning out of we're winning out of the money in the money or out of the money yeah correct that makesense see you get it this is the recipe and it's pretty straightforward
